MOTD(5)                    Linux Programmer's Manual                   MOTD(5)



NAME
       motd - message of the day

DESCRIPTION
       The  contents of /etc/motd are displayed by login(1) after a successful
       login but just before it executes the login shell.

       The abbreviation "motd" stands for "message of the day", and this  file
       has  been  traditionally  used  for exactly that (it requires much less
       disk space than mail to all users).

FILES
       /etc/motd

SEE ALSO
       login(1), issue(5)
