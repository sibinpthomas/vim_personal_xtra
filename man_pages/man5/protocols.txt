PROTOCOLS(5)               Linux Programmer's Manual              PROTOCOLS(5)



NAME
       protocols - protocols definition file

DESCRIPTION
       This  file is a plain ASCII file, describing the various DARPA internet
       protocols that are available from the TCP/IP subsystem.  It  should  be
       consulted  instead  of using the numbers in the ARPA include files, or,
       even worse, just guessing them.  These numbers will occur in the proto‐
       col field of any IP header.

       Keep  this  file  untouched  since changes would result in incorrect IP
       packages.  Protocol numbers and names are specified by the IANA (Inter‐
       net Assigned Numbers Authority).

       Each line is of the following format:

              protocol number aliases ...

       where  the  fields  are  delimited  by spaces or tabs.  Empty lines are
       ignored.  If a line contains a hash mark (#), the  hash  mark  and  the
       part of the line following it are ignored.

       The field descriptions are:

       protocol
              the native name for the protocol.  For example ip, tcp, or udp.

       number the  official  number for this protocol as it will appear within
              the IP header.

       aliases
              optional aliases for the protocol.

       This file might be distributed over a network using a network-wide nam‐
       ing service like Yellow Pages/NIS or BIND/Hesiod.
