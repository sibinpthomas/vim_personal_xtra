TTYTYPE(5)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                TTYTYPE(5)



NAME
       ttytype - terminal device to default terminal type mapping

DESCRIPTION
       The  /etc/ttytype  file associates termcap(5)/terminfo(5) terminal type
       names with tty lines.  Each line consists of a terminal type,  followed
       by whitespace, followed by a tty name (a device name without the /dev/)
       prefix.

       This association is used by the program tset(1) to set the  environment
       variable TERM to the default terminal name for the user's current tty.

       This  facility  was designed for a traditional time-sharing environment
       featuring character-cell terminals hardwired to  a  UNIX  minicomputer.
       It is little used on modern workstation and personal UNIX systems.

FILES
       /etc/ttytype
              the tty definitions file.

EXAMPLE
       A typical /etc/ttytype is:

              con80x25 tty1
              vt320 ttys0
