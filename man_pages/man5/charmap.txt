CHARMAP(5)                     Linux User Manual                    CHARMAP(5)



NAME
       charmap - character symbols to define character encodings

DESCRIPTION
       A character set description (charmap) defines a character set of avail‐
       able characters and their  encodings.   All  supported  character  sets
       should have the portable character set as a proper subset.

   Syntax
       The  charmap file starts with a header, that may consist of the follow‐
       ing keywords:

       <codeset>
              is followed by the name of the codeset.

       <mb_cur_max>
              is followed by the max number of bytes for  a  multibyte-charac‐
              ter.   Multibyte  characters  are  currently not supported.  The
              default value is 1.

       <mb_cur_min>
              is followed by the min number of bytes for  a  character.   This
              value  must be less or equal than mb_cur_max.  If not specified,
              it defaults to mb_cur_max.

       <escape_char>
              is followed by a character that should be used  as  the  escape-
              character  for  the  rest  of  the  file to mark characters that
              should be interpreted in a special  way.   It  defaults  to  the
              backslash ( \ ).

       <comment_char>
              is  followed  by  a  character that will be used as the comment-
              character for the rest of the file.  It defaults to  the  number
              sign ( # ).

       The charmap-definition itself starts with the keyword CHARMAP in column
       1.

       The following lines may have one of the two following forms  to  define
       the character-encodings:

       <symbolic-name> <encoding> <comments>
              This form defines exactly one character and its encoding.

       <symbolic-name>...<symbolic-name> <encoding> <comments>
              This  form  defines a couple of characters.  This is useful only
              for multibyte-characters, which are currently not implemented.

       The last line in a charmap-definition file must contain END CHARMAP.

   Symbolic names
       A symbolic name for a character contains only characters of the  porta‐
       ble character set.  The name itself is enclosed between angle brackets.
       Characters following an <escape_char> are interpreted  as  itself;  for
       example,  the  sequence <\\\>> represents the symbolic name \> enclosed
       in angle brackets.

   Character encoding
       The encoding may be in each of the following three forms:

       <escape_char>d<number>
              with a decimal number

       <escape_char>x<number>
              with a hexadecimal number

       <escape_char><number>
              with an octal number.
