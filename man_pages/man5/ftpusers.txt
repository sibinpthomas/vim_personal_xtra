FTPUSERS(5)                Linux Programmer's Manual               FTPUSERS(5)



NAME
       ftpusers - list of users that may not log in via the FTP daemon

DESCRIPTION
       The  text  file  ftpusers  contains a list of users that may not log in
       using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server  daemon.   This  file  is
       used  not  merely  for system administration purposes but for improving
       security within a TCP/IP networked environment.  It will typically con‐
       tain a list of the users that either have no business using ftp or have
       too many privileges to be allowed to log in through the FTP server dae‐
       mon.  Such users usually include root, daemon, bin, uucp, and news.  If
       your FTP server daemon doesn't use ftpusers then it is  suggested  that
       you  read its documentation to find out how to block access for certain
       users.  Washington University FTP server Daemon  (wuftpd)  and  Profes‐
       sional FTP Daemon (proftpd) are known to make use of ftpusers.

   Format
       The  format  of ftpusers is very simple.  There is one account name (or
       username) per line.  Lines starting with a # are ignored.

FILES
       /etc/ftpusers

SEE ALSO
       passwd(5), proftpd(8), wuftpd(8)
