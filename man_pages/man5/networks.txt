NAME
       networks - network name information

DESCRIPTION
       The file /etc/networks is a plain ASCII file that describes known DARPA
       networks and symbolic names for these networks.  Each line represents a
       network and has the following structure:

              name number aliases ...

       where  the  fields  are  delimited  by spaces or tabs.  Empty lines are
       ignored.  The hash character (#) indicates the start of a comment: this
       character,  and  the  remaining characters up to the end of the current
       line, are ignored by library functions that process the file.

       The field descriptions are:

       name   The symbolic name for the network.  Network  names  can  contain
              any  printable  characters execept white-space characters or the
              comment character.

       number The official number for this network in  numbers-and-dots  nota‐
              tion  (see  inet(3)).  The trailing ".0" (for the host component
              of the network address) may be omitted.

       aliases
              Optional aliases for the network.

       This file is read by the route(8) and netstat(8) utilities.  Only Class
       A,  B  or  C  networks  are supported, partitioned networks (i.e., net‐
       work/26 or network/28) are not supported by this facility.

FILES
       /etc/networks
              The networks definition file.
