LLSEEK(2)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 LLSEEK(2)



NAME
       _llseek - reposition read/write file offset

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <unistd.h>

       int _llseek(unsigned int fd, unsigned long offset_high,
                   unsigned long offset_low, loff_t *result,
                   unsigned int whence);

DESCRIPTION
       The  _llseek() function repositions the offset of the open file associ‐
       ated with the file descriptor  fd  to  (offset_high<<32)  |  offset_low
       bytes  relative  to  the beginning of the file, the current position in
       the file, or the end of  the  file,  depending  on  whether  whence  is
       SEEK_SET,  SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, respectively.  It returns the result‐
       ing file position in the argument result.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, _llseek() returns 0.  Otherwise, a value of
       -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not an open file descriptor.

       EFAULT Problem with copying results to user space.

       EINVAL whence is invalid.

CONFORMING TO
       This  function  is  Linux-specific,  and should not be used in programs
       intended to be portable.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call;  call  it  using
       syscall(2).
