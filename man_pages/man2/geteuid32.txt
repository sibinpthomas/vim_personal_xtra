GETUID(2)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 GETUID(2)



NAME
       getuid, geteuid - get user identity

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>
       #include <sys/types.h>

       uid_t getuid(void);
       uid_t geteuid(void);

DESCRIPTION
       getuid() returns the real user ID of the calling process.

       geteuid() returns the effective user ID of the calling process.

       When  a  normal  program is executed, the effective and real user ID of
       the process are set to the ID of the user executing the file.   When  a
       set  ID program is executed the real user ID is set to the calling user
       and the effective user ID corresponds to the set ID  bit  on  the  file
       being executed.

ERRORS
       These functions are always successful.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD.

NOTES
   History
       In  UNIX  V6  the  getuid()  call  returned (euid << 8) + uid.  UNIX V7
       introduced separate calls getuid() and geteuid().

NOTES
       The original Linux getuid() and geteuid() system calls  supported  only
       16-bit   user  IDs.   Subsequently,  Linux  2.4  added  getuid32()  and
       geteuid32(), supporting 32-bit IDs.  The glibc getuid()  and  geteuid()
       wrapper  functions transparently deal with the variations across kernel
       versions.
