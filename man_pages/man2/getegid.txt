GETGID(2)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 GETGID(2)



NAME
       getgid, getegid - get group identity

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>
       #include <sys/types.h>

       gid_t getgid(void);
       gid_t getegid(void);

DESCRIPTION
       getgid() returns the real group ID of the calling process.

       getegid() returns the effective group ID of the calling process.

       When  a  normal program is executed, the effective and real group ID of
       the process are set to the group ID of the  user  executing  the  file.
       When a set ID program is executed the real group ID is set to the group
       of the calling user and the effective user ID corresponds  to  the  set
       group ID bit on the file being executed.

ERRORS
       These functions are always successful.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD.

NOTES
       The  original  Linux getgid() and getegid() system calls supported only
       16-bit group IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added getgid32()  and  gete‐
       gid32(), supporting 32-bit IDs.  The glibc getgid() and getegid() wrap‐
       per functions transparently deal with the variations across kernel ver‐
       sions.
