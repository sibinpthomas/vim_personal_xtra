SGETMASK(2)                Linux Programmer's Manual               SGETMASK(2)



NAME
       sgetmask, ssetmask - manipulation of signal mask (obsolete)

SYNOPSIS
       long sgetmask(void);

       long ssetmask(long newmask);

DESCRIPTION
       These  system  calls are obsolete.  Do not use them; use sigprocmask(2)
       instead.

       sgetmask() returns the signal mask of the calling process.

       ssetmask() sets the signal mask of the calling  process  to  the  value
       given in newmask.  The previous signal mask is returned.

       The  signal  masks  dealt  with by these two system calls are plain bit
       masks (unlike the sigset_t used by sigprocmask(2)); use  sigmask(3)  to
       create and inspect these masks.

RETURN VALUE
       sgetmask()  always  successfully  returns  the signal mask.  ssetmask()
       always succeeds, and returns the previous signal mask.

ERRORS
       These system calls always succeed.

CONFORMING TO
       These system calls are Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide wrappers for these system calls; use syscall(2).

       These system calls are unaware of signal numbers greater than 31 (i.e.,
       real-time signals).

       It is not possible to block SIGSTOP or SIGKILL.
