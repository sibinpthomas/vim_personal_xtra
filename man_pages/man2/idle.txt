IDLE(2)                    Linux Programmer's Manual                   IDLE(2)



NAME
       idle - make process 0 idle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int idle(void);

DESCRIPTION
       idle()  is an internal system call used during bootstrap.  It marks the
       process's pages as swappable, lowers its priority, and enters the  main
       scheduling loop.  idle() never returns.

       Only  process 0 may call idle().  Any user process, even a process with
       superuser permission, will receive EPERM.

RETURN VALUE
       idle() never returns for process 0, and always returns -1  for  a  user
       process.

ERRORS
       EPERM  Always, for a user process.

VERSIONS
       Since Linux 2.3.13, this system call does not exist anymore.

CONFORMING TO
       This  function  is  Linux-specific,  and should not be used in programs
       intended to be portable.
