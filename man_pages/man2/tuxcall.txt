NAME
       afs_syscall,  break,  ftime,  getpmsg, gtty, lock, madvise1, mpx, prof,
       profil, putpmsg, security, stty, tuxcall, ulimit,  vserver  -  unimple‐
       mented system calls

SYNOPSIS
       Unimplemented system calls.

DESCRIPTION
       These system calls are not implemented in the Linux 2.6.22 kernel.

RETURN VALUE
       These system calls always return -1 and set errno to ENOSYS.

NOTES
       Note  that ftime(3), profil(3) and ulimit(3) are implemented as library
       functions.

       Some system calls,  like  alloc_hugepages(2),  free_hugepages(2),  iop‐
       erm(2), iopl(2), and vm86(2) only exist on certain architectures.

       Some  system  calls, like ipc(2), create_module(2), init_module(2), and
       delete_module(2) only exist when the Linux kernel was built  with  sup‐
       port for them.
