NAME
       hd - MFM/IDE hard disk devices

DESCRIPTION
       The hd* devices are block devices to access MFM/IDE hard disk drives in
       raw mode.  The master drive on the primary IDE controller (major device
       number 3) is hda; the slave drive is hdb.  The master drive of the sec‐
       ond controller (major device number 22) is hdc and the slave hdd.

       General IDE block device names have the form hdX, or hdXP, where X is a
       letter denoting the physical drive, and P is a number denoting the par‐
       tition on that physical drive.  The first form, hdX, is used to address
       the  whole drive.  Partition numbers are assigned in the order the par‐
       titions are discovered, and only nonempty, nonextended partitions get a
       number.   However,  partition  numbers 1-4 are given to the four parti‐
       tions described in the MBR (the "primary"  partitions),  regardless  of
       whether they are unused or extended.  Thus, the first logical partition
       will be hdX5.  Both DOS-type partitioning and BSD-disklabel  partition‐
       ing are supported.  You can have at most 63 partitions on an IDE disk.

       For  example, /dev/hda refers to all of the first IDE drive in the sys‐
       tem; and /dev/hdb3 refers to the third DOS "primary" partition  on  the
       second one.

       They are typically created by:

              mknod -m 660 /dev/hda b 3 0
              mknod -m 660 /dev/hda1 b 3 1
              mknod -m 660 /dev/hda2 b 3 2
              ...
              mknod -m 660 /dev/hda8 b 3 8
              mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb b 3 64
              mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb1 b 3 65
              mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb2 b 3 66
              ...
              mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb8 b 3 72
              chown root:disk /dev/hd*
