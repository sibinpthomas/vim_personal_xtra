NULL(4)                    Linux Programmer's Manual                   NULL(4)



NAME
       null, zero - data sink

DESCRIPTION
       Data written to a null or zero special file is discarded.

       Reads  from  the  null  special  file  always return end of file (i.e.,
       read(2) returns 0), whereas reads from zero always  return  bytes  con‐
       taining zero (\0 characters).

       null and zero are typically created by:

              mknod -m 666 /dev/null c 1 3
              mknod -m 666 /dev/zero c 1 5
              chown root:root /dev/null /dev/zero

FILES
       /dev/null
       /dev/zero

NOTES
       If these devices are not writable and readable for all users, many pro‐
       grams will act strangely.
