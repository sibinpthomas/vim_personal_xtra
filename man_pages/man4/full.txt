NAME
       full - always full device

CONFIGURATION
       If  your system does not have /dev/full created already, it can be cre‚Äê
       ated with the following commands:

               mknod -m 666 /dev/full c 1 7
               chown root:root /dev/full

DESCRIPTION
       File /dev/full has major device number 1 and minor device number 7.

       Writes to the /dev/full device will fail with an  ENOSPC  error.   This
       can be used to test how a program handles disk-full errors.

       Reads from the /dev/full device will return \0 characters.

       Seeks on /dev/full will always succeed.

FILES
       /dev/full
