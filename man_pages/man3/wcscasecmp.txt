WCSCASECMP(3)              Linux Programmer's Manual             WCSCASECMP(3)



NAME
       wcscasecmp - compare two wide-character strings, ignoring case

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcscasecmp(const wchar_t *s1, const wchar_t *s2);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       wcscasecmp():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  wcscasecmp() function is the wide-character equivalent of the str‐
       casecmp(3) function.  It compares the wide-character string pointed  to
       by  s1  and  the  wide-character string pointed to by s2, ignoring case
       differences (towupper(3), towlower(3)).

RETURN VALUE
       The wcscasecmp() function returns zero if the wide-character strings at
       s1  and  s2 are equal except for case distinctions.  It returns a posi‐
       tive integer if s1 is greater than s2, ignoring  case.   It  returns  a
       negative integer if s1 is smaller than s2, ignoring case.

VERSIONS
       The wcscasecmp() function is provided in glibc since version 2.1.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The  wcscasecmp()  function  is thread-safe with exceptions.  It can be
       safely used in multithreaded applications, as long as  setlocale(3)  is
       not called to change the locale.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.   This  function is not specified in POSIX.1-2001, and is
       not widely available on other systems.

NOTES
       The behavior of wcscasecmp() depends on the LC_CTYPE  category  of  the
       current locale.
