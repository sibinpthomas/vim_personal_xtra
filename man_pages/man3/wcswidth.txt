WCSWIDTH(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               WCSWIDTH(3)



NAME
       wcswidth  -  determine  columns  needed for a fixed-size wide-character
       string

SYNOPSIS
       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcswidth(const wchar_t *s, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcswidth() function returns the number of columns needed to  repre‐
       sent  the  wide-character  string  pointed  to by s, but at most n wide
       characters.  If a nonprintable wide character occurs among these  char‐
       acters, -1 is returned.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcswidth() function returns the number of column positions for the
       wide-character string s, truncated to at most length n.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The wcswidth() function is thread-safe  with  exceptions.   It  can  be
       safely  used  in multithreaded applications, as long as setlocale(3) is
       not called to change the locale.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The behavior of wcswidth() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur‐
       rent locale.
