SETLOGMASK(3)              Linux Programmer's Manual             SETLOGMASK(3)



NAME
       setlogmask - set log priority mask

SYNOPSIS
       #include <syslog.h>

       int setlogmask(int mask);

DESCRIPTION
       A  process  has a log priority mask that determines which calls to sys‐
       log(3) may be logged.  All other calls will  be  ignored.   Logging  is
       enabled for the priorities that have the corresponding bit set in mask.
       The initial mask is such that logging is enabled for all priorities.

       The setlogmask() function sets this logmask for  the  calling  process,
       and  returns the previous mask.  If the mask argument is 0, the current
       logmask is not modified.

       The eight  priorities  are  LOG_EMERG,  LOG_ALERT,  LOG_CRIT,  LOG_ERR,
       LOG_WARNING,  LOG_NOTICE, LOG_INFO, and LOG_DEBUG.  The bit correspond‐
       ing to a priority p is LOG_MASK(p).  Some systems also provide a  macro
       LOG_UPTO(p)  for the mask of all priorities in the above list up to and
       including p.

RETURN VALUE
       This function returns the previous log priority mask.

ERRORS
       None.
