TMPFILE(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                TMPFILE(3)



NAME
       tmpfile - create a temporary file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       FILE *tmpfile(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The  tmpfile()  function  opens  a  unique  temporary  file  in  binary
       read/write (w+b) mode.  The file will be automatically deleted when  it
       is closed or the program terminates.

RETURN VALUE
       The tmpfile() function returns a stream descriptor, or NULL if a unique
       filename cannot be generated or the unique file cannot be  opened.   In
       the latter case, errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EACCES Search permission denied for directory in file's path prefix.

       EEXIST Unable to generate a unique filename.

       EINTR  The call was interrupted by a signal.

       EMFILE Too many file descriptors in use by the process.

       ENFILE Too many files open in the system.

       ENOSPC There was no room in the directory to add the new filename.

       EROFS  Read-only filesystem.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99, SUSv2, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       POSIX.1-2001  specifies:  an  error message may be written to stdout if
       the stream cannot be opened.

       The standard does not specify the directory that  tmpfile()  will  use.
       Glibc  will  try  the path prefix P_tmpdir defined in <stdio.h>, and if
       that fails the directory /tmp.
