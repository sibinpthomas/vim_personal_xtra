DIV(3)                     Linux Programmer's Manual                    DIV(3)



NAME
       div,  ldiv, lldiv, imaxdiv - compute quotient and remainder of an inte‐
       ger division

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       div_t div(int numerator, int denominator);
       ldiv_t ldiv(long numerator, long denominator);
       lldiv_t lldiv(long long numerator, long long denominator);

       #include <inttypes.h>

       imaxdiv_t imaxdiv(intmax_t numerator, intmax_t denominator);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       lldiv():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE ||
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The div() function computes the value numerator/denominator and returns
       the quotient and remainder in a structure named div_t that contains two
       integer  members  (in  unspecified order) named quot and rem.  The quo‐
       tient is rounded toward  zero.   The  result  satisfies  quot*denomina‐
       tor+rem = numerator.

       The ldiv(), lldiv(), and imaxdiv() functions do the same, dividing num‐
       bers of the indicated type and returning the result in a  structure  of
       the  indicated  name, in all cases with fields quot and rem of the same
       type as the function arguments.

RETURN VALUE
       The div_t (etc.) structure.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89.  The functions lldiv() and imaxdiv() were  added  in
       C99.

EXAMPLE
       After

               div_t q = div(-5, 3);

       the values q.quot and q.rem are -1 and -2, respectively.
