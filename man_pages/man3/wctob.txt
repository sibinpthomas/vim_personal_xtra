NAME
       wctob - try to represent a wide character as a single byte

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wctob(wint_t c);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wctob() function tests whether the multibyte representation of the
       wide character c, starting in the initial state, consists of  a  single
       byte.  If so, it is returned as an unsigned char.

       Never  use this function.  It cannot help you in writing international‐
       ized programs.  Internationalized programs must never distinguish  sin‐
       gle-byte and multibyte characters.

RETURN VALUE
       The wctob() function returns the single-byte representation of c, if it
       exists, of EOF otherwise.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of wctob() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current
       locale.

       This  function  should  never be used.  Internationalized programs must
       never distinguish single-byte and  multibyte  characters.   Use  either
       wctomb(3) or the thread-safe wcrtomb(3) instead.
