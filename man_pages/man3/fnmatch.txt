FNMATCH(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                FNMATCH(3)



NAME
       fnmatch - match filename or pathname

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fnmatch.h>

       int fnmatch(const char *pattern, const char *string, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fnmatch()  function checks whether the string argument matches the
       pattern argument, which is a shell wildcard pattern.

       The flags argument modifies the behavior; it is the bitwise OR of  zero
       or more of the following flags:

       FNM_NOESCAPE
              If  this  flag is set, treat backslash as an ordinary character,
              instead of an escape character.

       FNM_PATHNAME
              If this flag is set, match a slash in string only with  a  slash
              in  pattern  and  not  by an asterisk (*) or a question mark (?)
              metacharacter, nor by a bracket  expression  ([])  containing  a
              slash.

       FNM_PERIOD
              If  this  flag  is  set,  a  leading  period in string has to be
              matched exactly by a period in pattern.  A period is  considered
              to be leading if it is the first character in string, or if both
              FNM_PATHNAME is set and the period immediately follows a slash.

       FNM_FILE_NAME
              This is a GNU synonym for FNM_PATHNAME.

       FNM_LEADING_DIR
              If this flag (a GNU extension) is set, the pattern is considered
              to  be  matched if it matches an initial segment of string which
              is followed by a slash.  This flag is mainly  for  the  internal
              use of glibc and is implemented only in certain cases.

       FNM_CASEFOLD
              If  this  flag  (a GNU extension) is set, the pattern is matched
              case-insensitively.

RETURN VALUE
       Zero if string matches pattern, FNM_NOMATCH if there  is  no  match  or
       another nonzero value if there is an error.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.2.   The  FNM_FILE_NAME,  FNM_LEADING_DIR, and FNM_CASEFOLD flags
       are GNU extensions.
