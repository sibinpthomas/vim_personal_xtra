PTHREAD_EQUAL(3)           Linux Programmer's Manual          PTHREAD_EQUAL(3)



NAME
       pthread_equal - compare thread IDs

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_equal(pthread_t t1, pthread_t t2);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_equal() function compares two thread identifiers.

RETURN VALUE
       If  the  two  thread  IDs  are equal, pthread_equal() returns a nonzero
       value; otherwise, it returns 0.

ERRORS
       This function always succeeds.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The pthread_equal() function is necessary because thread IDs should  be
       considered  opaque:  there  is  no  portable  way  for  applications to
       directly compare two pthread_t values.
