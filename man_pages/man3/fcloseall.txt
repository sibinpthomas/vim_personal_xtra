FCLOSEALL(3)               Linux Programmer's Manual              FCLOSEALL(3)



NAME
       fcloseall - close all open streams

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <stdio.h>

       int fcloseall(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fcloseall()  function  closes  all  of  the calling process's open
       streams.  Buffered output for each  stream  is  written  before  it  is
       closed (as for fflush(3)); buffered input is discarded.

       The standard streams, stdin, stdout, and stderr are also closed.

RETURN VALUE
       This  function  returns  0  if  all  files were successfully closed; on
       error, EOF is returned.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The fcloseall() function does not  lock  the  streams,  so  it  is  not
       thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.
