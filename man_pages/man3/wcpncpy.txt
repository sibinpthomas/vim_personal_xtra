WCPNCPY(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                WCPNCPY(3)



NAME
       wcpncpy  -  copy  a  fixed-size  string of wide characters, returning a
       pointer to its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcpncpy(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src, size_t n);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       wcpncpy():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The wcpncpy() function is the wide-character  equivalent  of  the  stp‐
       ncpy(3)  function.   It copies at most n wide characters from the wide-
       character string pointed to by src, including the terminating null wide
       (L'\0'),  to  the  array pointed to by dest.  Exactly n wide characters
       are written at dest.  If the length wcslen(src) is smaller than n,  the
       remaining  wide  characters  in the array pointed to by dest are filled
       with L'\0' characters.  If the length wcslen(src) is greater  or  equal
       to n, the string pointed to by dest will not be L'\0' terminated.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide char‐
       acters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcpncpy() returns a pointer to the last wide  character  written,  that
       is, dest+n-1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.
