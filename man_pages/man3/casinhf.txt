NAME
       casinh, casinhf, casinhl - complex arc sine hyperbolic

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double complex casinh(double complex z);
       float complex casinhf(float complex z);
       long double complex casinhl(long double complex z);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       The  casinh() function calculates the complex arc hyperbolic sine of z.
       If y = casinh(z), then z = csinh(y).  The imaginary part of y is chosen
       in the interval [-pi/2,pi/2].

       One has:

           casinh(z) = clog(z + csqrt(z * z + 1))

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
