RE_COMP(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                RE_COMP(3)



NAME
       re_comp, re_exec - BSD regex functions

SYNOPSIS
       #define _REGEX_RE_COMP
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <regex.h>

       char *re_comp(char *regex);

       int re_exec(char *string);

DESCRIPTION
       re_comp()  is  used  to  compile the null-terminated regular expression
       pointed to by regex.  The compiled pattern occupies a static area,  the
       pattern  buffer,  which  is overwritten by subsequent use of re_comp().
       If regex is NULL, no operation is performed and  the  pattern  buffer's
       contents are not altered.

       re_exec()  is used to assess whether the null-terminated string pointed
       to by string matches the previously compiled regex.

RETURN VALUE
       re_comp() returns NULL on successful compilation of regex otherwise  it
       returns a pointer to an appropriate error message.

       re_exec() returns 1 for a successful match, zero for failure.

CONFORMING TO
       4.3BSD.

NOTES
       These  functions  are  obsolete; the functions documented in regcomp(3)
       should be used instead.
