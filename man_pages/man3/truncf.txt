TRUNC(3)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  TRUNC(3)



NAME
       trunc, truncf, truncl - round to integer, toward zero

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double trunc(double x);
       float truncf(float x);
       long double truncl(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       trunc(), truncf(), truncl():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE ||
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       These functions round x to the nearest integer not larger  in  absolute
       value.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return the rounded integer value.

       If x is integral, infinite, or NaN, x itself is returned.

ERRORS
       No errors occur.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The  integral  value  returned  by  these functions may be too large to
       store in an integer type (int, long,  etc.).   To  avoid  an  overflow,
       which  will  produce undefined results, an application should perform a
       range check on the returned value before assigning  it  to  an  integer
       type.
