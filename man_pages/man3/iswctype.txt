ISWCTYPE(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               ISWCTYPE(3)



NAME
       iswctype - wide-character classification

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswctype(wint_t wc, wctype_t desc);

DESCRIPTION
       If  wc  is a wide character having the character property designated by
       desc (or in other words: belongs to the character class  designated  by
       desc),  the  iswctype() function returns nonzero.  Otherwise it returns
       zero.  If wc is WEOF, zero is returned.

       desc must be a character property descriptor returned by the  wctype(3)
       function.

RETURN VALUE
       The  iswctype()  function  returns nonzero if the wc has the designated
       property.  Otherwise it returns 0.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswctype() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur‐
       rent locale.
