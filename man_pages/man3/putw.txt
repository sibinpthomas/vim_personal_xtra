GETW(3)                    Linux Programmer's Manual                   GETW(3)



NAME
       getw, putw - input and output of words (ints)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       int getw(FILE *stream);

       int putw(int w, FILE *stream);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       getw(), putw():
           Since glibc 2.3.3:
               _SVID_SOURCE || _BSD_SOURCE ||
               (_XOPEN_SOURCE &&
                   !(_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600))
           Before glibc 2.3.3:
               _SVID_SOURCE || _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       getw()  reads  a word (that is, an int) from stream.  It's provided for
       compatibility with SVr4.  We recommend you use fread(3) instead.

       putw() writes the word w (that is, an int) to stream.  It  is  provided
       for  compatibility  with  SVr4,  but  we  recommend  you  use fwrite(3)
       instead.

RETURN VALUE
       Normally, getw() returns the word  read,  and  putw()  returns  0.   On
       error, they return EOF.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, SUSv2.  Not present in POSIX.1-2001.

BUGS
       The value returned on error is also a legitimate data value.  ferror(3)
       can be used to distinguish between the two cases.
