ULIMIT(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 ULIMIT(3)



NAME
       ulimit - get and set user limits

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ulimit.h>

       long ulimit(int cmd, long newlimit);

DESCRIPTION
       Warning: This routine is obsolete.  Use getrlimit(2), setrlimit(2), and
       sysconf(3) instead.  For the shell command ulimit(), see bash(1).

       The ulimit() call will get or set some limit for the  calling  process.
       The cmd argument can have one of the following values.

       UL_GETFSIZE
              Return the limit on the size of a file, in units of 512 bytes.

       UL_SETFSIZE
              Set the limit on the size of a file.

       3      (Not  implemented  for  Linux.)   Return  the  maximum  possible
              address of the data segment.

       4      (Implemented but no symbolic  constant  provided.)   Return  the
              maximum number of files that the calling process can open.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  ulimit()  returns  a  nonnegative value.  On error, -1 is
       returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EPERM  A unprivileged process tried to increase a limit.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2008 marks ulimit() as obsolete.
