GETWCHAR(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               GETWCHAR(3)



NAME
       getwchar - read a wide character from standard input

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t getwchar(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The  getwchar()  function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of  the
       getchar(3) function.  It reads a wide character from stdin and  returns
       it.  If the end of stream is reached, or if ferror(stdin) becomes true,
       it returns WEOF.  If a wide-character conversion error occurs, it  sets
       errno to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.

       For a nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The  getwchar()  function returns the next wide-character from standard
       input, or WEOF.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of getwchar() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur‐
       rent locale.

       It  is reasonable to expect that getwchar() will actually read a multi‐
       byte sequence from standard input and then convert it to a wide charac‐
       ter.
