GETUMASK(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               GETUMASK(3)



NAME
       getumask - get file creation mask

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/stat.h>

       mode_t getumask(void);

DESCRIPTION
       This function returns the current file creation mask.  It is equivalent
       to

           mode_t getumask(void)
           {
               mode_t mask = umask( 0 );
               umask(mask);
               return mask;
           }

       except that it is documented to be thread-safe (that is, shares a  lock
       with the umask(2) library call).

CONFORMING TO
       This is a vaporware GNU extension.

NOTES
       This  function  is  documented  but not implemented yet in glibc, as at
       version 2.9.
