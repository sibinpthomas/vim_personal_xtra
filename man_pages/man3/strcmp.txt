STRCMP(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 STRCMP(3)



NAME
       strcmp, strncmp - compare two strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);

       int strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strcmp()  function compares the two strings s1 and s2.  It returns
       an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if  s1  is  found,
       respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2.

       The  strncmp()  function  is similar, except it compares the only first
       (at most) n bytes of s1 and s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The strcmp() and strncmp() functions return an integer less than, equal
       to, or greater than zero if s1 (or the first n bytes thereof) is found,
       respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2.
