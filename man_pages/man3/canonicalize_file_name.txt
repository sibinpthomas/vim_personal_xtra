CANONICALIZE_FILE_NAME(3)  Linux Programmer's Manual CANONICALIZE_FILE_NAME(3)



NAME
       canonicalize_file_name - return the canonicalized absolute pathname

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *canonicalize_file_name(const char *path);

DESCRIPTION
       The  canonicalize_file_name() function returns a null-terminated string
       containing the canonicalized absolute pathname corresponding  to  path.
       In  the  returned string, symbolic links are resolved, as are .  and ..
       pathname components.  Consecutive slash (/) characters are replaced  by
       a single slash.

       The   returned   string   is   dynamically   allocated   by  canonical‚Äê
       ize_file_name() and the caller should deallocate it with  free(3)  when
       it is no longer required.

       The call canonicalize_file_name(path) is equivalent to the call:

           realpath(path, NULL);

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, canonicalize_file_name() returns a null-terminated string.
       On error (e.g., a pathname component is unreadable or does not  exist),
       canonicalize_file_name()  returns  NULL  and sets errno to indicate the
       error.

ERRORS
       See realpath(3).

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.
