NAME
       csqrt, csqrtf, csqrtl - complex square root

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double complex csqrt(double complex z);
       float complex csqrtf(float complex z);
       long double complex csqrtl(long double complex z);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       Calculate  the  square root of a given complex number, with nonnegative
       real part, and with a branch cut along the negative real  axis.   (That
       means  that  csqrt(-1+eps*I)  will  be close to I while csqrt(-1-eps*I)
       will be close to -I, if eps is a small positive real number.)

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
