FTIME(3)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  FTIME(3)



NAME
       ftime - return date and time

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/timeb.h>

       int ftime(struct timeb *tp);

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  returns  the  current  time as seconds and milliseconds
       since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).  The time is returned
       in tp, which is declared as follows:

           struct timeb {
               time_t         time;
               unsigned short millitm;
               short          timezone;
               short          dstflag;
           };

       Here  time is the number of seconds since the Epoch, and millitm is the
       number of milliseconds since time seconds since the Epoch.   The  time‐
       zone  field  is  the local timezone measured in minutes of time west of
       Greenwich (with a negative value indicating minutes east of Greenwich).
       The  dstflag  field is a flag that, if nonzero, indicates that Daylight
       Saving time applies locally during the appropriate part of the year.

       POSIX.1-2001 says that the contents of the timezone and dstflag  fields
       are unspecified; avoid relying on them.

RETURN VALUE
       This function always returns 0.  (POSIX.1-2001 specifies, and some sys‐
       tems document, a -1 error return.)

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The ftime() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       4.2BSD,  POSIX.1-2001.   POSIX.1-2008  removes  the  specification   of
       ftime().

       This  function is obsolete.  Don't use it.  If the time in seconds suf‐
       fices,  time(2)  can  be  used;  gettimeofday(2)  gives   microseconds;
       clock_gettime(2) gives nanoseconds but is not as widely available.

BUGS
       Under  libc4  and  libc5  the  millitm  field is meaningful.  But early
       glibc2 is buggy and returns 0 there; glibc 2.1.1 is correct again.
