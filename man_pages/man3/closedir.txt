NAME
       closedir - close a directory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>

       #include <dirent.h>

       int closedir(DIR *dirp);

DESCRIPTION
       The  closedir()  function  closes  the directory stream associated with
       dirp.  A successful call to closedir() also closes the underlying  file
       descriptor  associated with dirp.  The directory stream descriptor dirp
       is not available after this call.

RETURN VALUE
       The closedir()  function  returns  0  on  success.   On  error,  -1  is
       returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  Invalid directory stream descriptor dirp.
