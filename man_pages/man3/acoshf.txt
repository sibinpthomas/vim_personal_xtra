ACOSH(3)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  ACOSH(3)



NAME
       acosh, acoshf, acoshl - inverse hyperbolic cosine function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double acosh(double x);
       float acoshf(float x);
       long double acoshl(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       acosh():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 ||
           _XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED || _ISOC99_SOURCE ||
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99
       acoshf(), acoshl():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 ||
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The acosh() function calculates the inverse  hyperbolic  cosine  of  x;
       that is the value whose hyperbolic cosine is x.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the inverse hyperbolic cosine of x.

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is +1, +0 is returned.

       If x is positive infinity, positive infinity is returned.

       If  x is less than 1, a domain error occurs, and the functions return a
       NaN.

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an  error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Domain error: x is less than 1
              errno  is  set  to  EDOM.   An  invalid floating-point exception
              (FE_INVALID) is raised.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.  The variant returning double also conforms to SVr4,
       4.3BSD, C89.
