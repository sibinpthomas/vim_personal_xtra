WCSDUP(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 WCSDUP(3)



NAME
       wcsdup - duplicate a wide-character string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcsdup(const wchar_t *s);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       wcsdup():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsdup() function is the wide-character equivalent of the strdup(3)
       function.  It allocates and returns a new wide-character  string  whose
       initial contents is a duplicate of the wide-character string pointed to
       by s.

       Memory for the new wide-character string is  obtained  with  malloc(3),
       and should be freed with free(3).

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  wcsdup()  returns  a  pointer  to  the new wide-character
       string.  On error, it returns -1, with errno set to indicate the  cause
       of the error.

ERRORS
       ENOMEM Insufficient memory available to allocate duplicate string.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.   This  function is not specified in POSIX.1-2001, and is
       not widely available on other systems.
