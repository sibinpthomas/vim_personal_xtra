SCANDIRAT(3)               Linux Programmer's Manual              SCANDIRAT(3)



NAME
       scandirat - scan a directory relative to a directory file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */

       #include <fcntl.h>          /* Definition of AT_* constants */
       #include <dirent.h>

       int scandirat(int dirfd, const char *dirp, struct dirent ***namelist,
              int (*filter)(const struct dirent *),
              int (*compar)(const struct dirent **, const struct dirent **));

DESCRIPTION
       The  scandirat()  system call operates in exactly the same way as scan‐
       dir(3), except for the differences described in this manual page.

       If the pathname given in dirp is relative, then it is interpreted rela‐
       tive  to the directory referred to by the file descriptor dirfd (rather
       than relative to the current working directory of the calling  process,
       as is done by scandir(3) for a relative pathname).

       If  dirp is relative and dirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then dirp
       is interpreted relative to the current working directory of the calling
       process (like scandir(3)).

       If dirp is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  scandirat()  returns  the  number  of  directory  entries
       selected.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set  to  indicate  the
       error.

ERRORS
       The  same  errors  that occur for scandir(3) can also occur for scandi‐
       rat().  The following additional errors can occur for scandirat():

       EBADF  dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOTDIR
              dirp is a relative path and dirfd is a file descriptor referring
              to a file other than a directory.

VERSIONS
       scandirat() was added to glibc in version 2.15.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.

NOTES
       See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for scandirat().
