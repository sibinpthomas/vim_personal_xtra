WMEMCMP(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                WMEMCMP(3)



NAME
       wmemcmp - compare two arrays of wide-characters

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wmemcmp(const wchar_t *s1, const wchar_t *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wmemcmp()  function  is  the wide-character equivalent of the mem‚Äê
       cmp(3) function.  It compares the n wide-characters starting at s1  and
       the n wide-characters starting at s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wmemcmp()  function  returns  zero if the wide-character arrays of
       size n at s1 and s2 are equal.  It returns an integer greater than zero
       if  at  the first differing position i (i < n), the corresponding wide-
       character s1[i] is greater than s2[i].  It returns an integer less than
       zero  if  at  the first differing position i (i < n), the corresponding
       wide-character s1[i] is less than s2[i].

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The wmemcmp() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
