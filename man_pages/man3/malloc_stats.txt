MALLOC_STATS(3)            Linux Programmer's Manual           MALLOC_STATS(3)



NAME
       malloc_stats - print memory allocation statistics

SYNOPSIS
       #include <malloc.h>

       void malloc_stats(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The malloc_stats() function prints (on standard error) statistics about
       memory allocated by malloc(3) and related functions.   For  each  arena
       (allocation  area),  this  function  prints  the total amount of memory
       allocated and the total number of bytes consumed by in-use allocations.
       (These two values correspond to the arena and uordblks fields retrieved
       by mallinfo(3).)  In addition, the function prints the sum of these two
       statistics  for  all arenas, and the maximum number of blocks and bytes
       that were ever simultaneously allocated using mmap(2).

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.

NOTES
       More detailed information about memory allocations in  the  main  arena
       can be obtained using mallinfo(3).
