MEMMOVE(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                MEMMOVE(3)



NAME
       memmove - copy memory area

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       void *memmove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  memmove()  function  copies n bytes from memory area src to memory
       area dest.  The memory areas may overlap: copying takes place as though
       the  bytes in src are first copied into a temporary array that does not
       overlap src or dest, and the bytes are then copied from  the  temporary
       array to dest.

RETURN VALUE
       The memmove() function returns a pointer to dest.
