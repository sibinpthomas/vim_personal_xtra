SEM_DESTROY(3)             Linux Programmer's Manual            SEM_DESTROY(3)



NAME
       sem_destroy - destroy an unnamed semaphore

SYNOPSIS
       #include <semaphore.h>

       int sem_destroy(sem_t *sem);

       Link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       sem_destroy()  destroys the unnamed semaphore at the address pointed to
       by sem.

       Only a semaphore that has been initialized  by  sem_init(3)  should  be
       destroyed using sem_destroy().

       Destroying  a  semaphore  that other processes or threads are currently
       blocked on (in sem_wait(3)) produces undefined behavior.

       Using a semaphore that has been destroyed produces  undefined  results,
       until the semaphore has been reinitialized using sem_init(3).

RETURN VALUE
       sem_destroy() returns 0 on success; on error, -1 is returned, and errno
       is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL sem is not a valid semaphore.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       An unnamed semaphore should be destroyed with sem_destroy() before  the
       memory  in  which it is located is deallocated.  Failure to do this can
       result in resource leaks on some implementations.
