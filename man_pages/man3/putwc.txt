FPUTWC(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 FPUTWC(3)



NAME
       fputwc, putwc - write a wide character to a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t fputwc(wchar_t wc, FILE *stream);
       wint_t putwc(wchar_t wc, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fputwc() function is the wide-character equivalent of the fputc(3)
       function.  It  writes  the  wide  character  wc  to  stream.   If  fer‐
       ror(stream) becomes true, it returns WEOF.  If a wide-character conver‐
       sion error occurs, it sets errno to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.  Otherwise
       it returns wc.

       The  putwc()  function  or macro functions identically to fputwc().  It
       may be implemented as a macro, and may evaluate its argument more  than
       once.  There is no reason ever to use it.

       For nonlocking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The fputwc() function returns wc if no error occurred, or WEOF to indi‐
       cate an error.

ERRORS
       Apart from the usual ones, there is

       EILSEQ Conversion of wc to the stream's encoding fails.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The behavior of fputwc() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of  the  cur‐
       rent locale.

       In  the  absence of additional information passed to the fopen(3) call,
       it is reasonable to expect that fputwc() will actually write the multi‐
       byte sequence corresponding to the wide character wc.
