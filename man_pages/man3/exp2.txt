EXP2(3)                    Linux Programmer's Manual                   EXP2(3)



NAME
       exp2, exp2f, exp2l - base-2 exponential function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double exp2(double x);
       float exp2f(float x);
       long double exp2l(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       exp2(), exp2f(), exp2l():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE ||
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The exp2() function returns the value of 2 raised to the power of x.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the base-2 exponential value of x.

       For various special cases, including the handling of infinity and  NaN,
       as well as overflows and underflows, see exp(3).

ERRORS
       See  math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       For a discussion of the errors that can occur for these functions,  see
       exp(3).

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.  The variant returning double also conforms to SVr4,
       4.3BSD, C89.
