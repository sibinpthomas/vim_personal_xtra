NAME
       cabs, cabsf, cabsl - absolute value of a complex number

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double cabs(double complex z);
       float cabsf(float complex z);
       long double cabsl(long double complex z);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       The cabs() function returns the absolute value of the complex number z.
       The result is a real number.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The function is actually an alias for  hypot(a, b)  (or,  equivalently,
       sqrt(a*a + b*b)).
