DIFFTIME(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               DIFFTIME(3)



NAME
       difftime - calculate time difference

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       double difftime(time_t time1, time_t time0);

DESCRIPTION
       The  difftime()  function returns the number of seconds elapsed between
       time time1 and time time0, represented as a double.  Each of the  times
       is  specified  in calendar time, which means its value is a measurement
       (in seconds) relative to the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The difftime() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.

NOTES
       On a POSIX system, time_t is an arithmetic type,  and  one  could  just
       define

              #define difftime(t1,t0) (double)(t1 - t0)

       when the possible overflow in the subtraction is not a concern.
