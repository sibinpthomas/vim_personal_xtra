NAME
       wcsspn  -  advance in a wide-character string, skipping any of a set of
       wide characters

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t wcsspn(const wchar_t *wcs, const wchar_t *accept);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsspn() function is the wide-character equivalent of the strspn(3)
       function.   It  determines the length of the longest initial segment of
       wcs which consists entirely of wide-characters listed  in  accept.   In
       other words, it searches for the first occurrence in the wide-character
       string wcs of a wide-character  not  contained  in  the  wide-character
       string accept.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcsspn()  function  returns  the  number of wide characters in the
       longest initial segment of wcs which consists entirely of  wide-charac‚Äê
       ters  listed in accept.  In other words, it returns the position of the
       first occurrence in the wide-character string wcs of  a  wide-character
       not  contained  in  the wide-character string accept, or wcslen(wcs) if
       there is none.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The wcsspn() function is thread-safe.
