PTHREAD_YIELD(3)           Linux Programmer's Manual          PTHREAD_YIELD(3)



NAME
       pthread_yield - yield the processor

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_yield(void);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       pthread_yield()  causes  the calling thread to relinquish the CPU.  The
       thread is placed at the end of the run queue for  its  static  priority
       and  another  thread  is  scheduled  to  run.  For further details, see
       sched_yield(2)

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_yield() returns 0; on error, it  returns  an  error
       number.

ERRORS
       On  Linux,  this  call  always  succeeds (but portable and future-proof
       applications should nevertheless handle a possible error return).

CONFORMING TO
       This call is nonstandard, but present on several  other  systems.   Use
       the standardized sched_yield(2) instead.

NOTES
       On Linux, this function is implemented as a call to sched_yield(2).
