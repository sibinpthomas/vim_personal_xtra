ISWGRAPH(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               ISWGRAPH(3)



NAME
       iswgraph - test for graphic wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswgraph(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswgraph()  function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of  the
       isgraph(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character belonging
       to the wide-character class "graph".

       The  wide-character  class  "graph" is a subclass of the wide-character
       class "print".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the  wide-charac‐
       ter class "graph" is disjoint from the wide-character class "cntrl".

       The  wide-character  class  "graph" is disjoint from the wide-character
       class "space" and therefore also disjoint from its subclass "blank".

       The wide-character class "graph" contains all the wide characters  from
       the wide-character class "print" except the space character.  It there‐
       fore contains the wide-character classes "alnum" and "punct".

RETURN VALUE
       The iswgraph() function returns nonzero  if  wc  is  a  wide  character
       belonging  to  the  wide-character class "graph".  Otherwise it returns
       zero.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswgraph() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur‐
       rent locale.
