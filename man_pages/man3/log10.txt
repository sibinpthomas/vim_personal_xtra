LOG10(3)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  LOG10(3)



NAME
       log10, log10f, log10l -  base-10 logarithmic function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double log10(double x);
       float log10f(float x);
       long double log10l(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       log10f(), log10l():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 ||
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The log10() function returns the base 10 logarithm of x.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the base 10 logarithm of x.

       For special cases, including where x is 0, 1,  negative,  infinity,  or
       NaN, see log(3).

ERRORS
       See  math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       For a discussion of the errors that can occur for these functions,  see
       log(3).

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.  The variant returning double also conforms to SVr4,
       4.3BSD, C89.
