NAME
       btowc - convert single byte to wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t btowc(int c);

DESCRIPTION
       The btowc() function converts c, interpreted as a multibyte sequence of
       length 1, starting in the initial shift state, to a wide character  and
       returns it.  If c is EOF or not a valid multibyte sequence of length 1,
       the btowc() function returns WEOF.

RETURN VALUE
       The btowc() function returns the wide character converted from the sin‐
       gle byte c.  If c is EOF or not a valid multibyte sequence of length 1,
       it returns WEOF.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The behavior of btowc() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current
       locale.

       This  function  should  never  be used.  It does not work for encodings
       which have state, and unnecessarily  treats  single  bytes  differently
       from multibyte sequences.  Use either mbtowc(3) or the thread-safe mbr‐
       towc(3) instead.
