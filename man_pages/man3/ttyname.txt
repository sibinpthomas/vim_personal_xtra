TTYNAME(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                TTYNAME(3)



NAME
       ttyname, ttyname_r - return name of a terminal

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       char *ttyname(int fd);

       int ttyname_r(int fd, char *buf, size_t buflen);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  ttyname() returns a pointer to the null-terminated path‐
       name of the terminal device that is open on the file descriptor fd,  or
       NULL on error (for example, if fd is not connected to a terminal).  The
       return value may point to static data, possibly overwritten by the next
       call.   The function ttyname_r() stores this pathname in the buffer buf
       of length buflen.

RETURN VALUE
       The function ttyname() returns a pointer to a pathname on success.   On
       error,  NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.  The function
       ttyname_r() returns 0 on success, and an error number upon error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  Bad file descriptor.

       ENOTTY File descriptor does not refer to a terminal device.

       ERANGE (ttyname_r()) buflen was too small to allow  storing  the  path‐
              name.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The ttyname() function is not thread-safe.

       The ttyname_r() function is thread-safe.
