PTHREAD_SIGQUEUE(3)        Linux Programmer's Manual       PTHREAD_SIGQUEUE(3)



NAME
       pthread_sigqueue - queue a signal and data to a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_sigqueue(pthread_t thread, int sig,
                            const union sigval value);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       pthread_sigqueue(): _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_sigqueue() function performs a similar task to sigqueue(3),
       but, rather than sending a signal to a process, it sends a signal to  a
       thread in the same process as the calling thread.

       The  thread  argument  is the ID of a thread in the same process as the
       caller.  The sig argument specifies the signal to be sent.   The  value
       argument  specifies  data  to accompany the signal; see sigqueue(3) for
       details.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_sigqueue() returns 0; on error, it returns an error
       number.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN The limit of signals which may be queued has been reached.  (See
              signal(7) for further information.)

       EINVAL sig was invalid.

       ENOSYS pthread_sigqueue() is not supported on this system.

       ESRCH  thread is not valid.

VERSIONS
       The pthread_sigqueue() function first appeared in glibc 2.11.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.
