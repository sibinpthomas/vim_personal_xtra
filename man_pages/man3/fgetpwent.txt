FGETPWENT(3)               Linux Programmer's Manual              FGETPWENT(3)



NAME
       fgetpwent - get password file entry

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <pwd.h>

       struct passwd *fgetpwent(FILE *stream);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fgetpwent(): _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  fgetpwent()  function  returns a pointer to a structure containing
       the broken out fields of a line in the file stream.  The first time  it
       is called it returns the first entry; thereafter, it returns successive
       entries.  The file referred to by stream must have the same  format  as
       /etc/passwd (see passwd(5)).

       The passwd structure is defined in <pwd.h> as follows:

           struct passwd {
               char   *pw_name;       /* username */
               char   *pw_passwd;     /* user password */
               uid_t   pw_uid;        /* user ID */
               gid_t   pw_gid;        /* group ID */
               char   *pw_gecos;      /* real name */
               char   *pw_dir;        /* home directory */
               char   *pw_shell;      /* shell program */
           };

RETURN VALUE
       The  fgetpwent()  function  returns a pointer to a passwd structure, or
       NULL if there are no more entries or an error occurs.  In the event  of
       an error, errno is set to indicate the cause.

ERRORS
       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to allocate passwd structure.

FILES
       /etc/passwd
              password database file
