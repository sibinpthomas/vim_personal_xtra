WCTRANS(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                WCTRANS(3)



NAME
       wctrans - wide-character translation mapping

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wctrans_t wctrans(const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wctrans_t type represents a mapping which can map a wide character
       to another wide character.  Its nature is implementation-dependent, but
       the  special  value  (wctrans_t) 0 denotes an invalid mapping.  Nonzero
       wctrans_t values can be passed to the towctrans(3) function to actually
       perform the wide-character mapping.

       The  wctrans()  function returns a mapping, given by its name.  The set
       of valid names depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current  locale,
       but the following names are valid in all locales.
         "tolower" - realizes the tolower(3) mapping
         "toupper" - realizes the toupper(3) mapping

RETURN VALUE
       The  wctrans()  function  returns  a  mapping descriptor if the name is
       valid.  Otherwise it returns (wctrans_t) 0.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The wctrans() function is  thread-safe  with  exceptions.   It  can  be
       safely  used  in multithreaded applications, as long as setlocale(3) is
       not called to change the locale.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of wctrans() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the  cur‚Äê
       rent locale.
