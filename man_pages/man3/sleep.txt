SLEEP(3)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  SLEEP(3)



NAME
       sleep - sleep for the specified number of seconds

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       unsigned int sleep(unsigned int seconds);

DESCRIPTION
       sleep()  makes  the  calling  thread  sleep  until seconds seconds have
       elapsed or a signal arrives which is not ignored.

RETURN VALUE
       Zero if the requested time has elapsed, or the number of  seconds  left
       to sleep, if the call was interrupted by a signal handler.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

BUGS
       sleep()  may be implemented using SIGALRM; mixing calls to alarm(2) and
       sleep() is a bad idea.

       Using longjmp(3) from a signal handler or  modifying  the  handling  of
       SIGALRM while sleeping will cause undefined results.
