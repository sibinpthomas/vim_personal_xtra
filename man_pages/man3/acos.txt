ACOS(3)                    Linux Programmer's Manual                   ACOS(3)



NAME
       acos, acosf, acosl - arc cosine function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double acos(double x);
       float acosf(float x);
       long double acosl(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       acosf(), acosl():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 ||
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The acos() function calculates the arc cosine of x; that is  the  value
       whose cosine is x.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, these functions return the arc cosine of x in radians; the
       return value is in the range [0, pi].

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is +1, +0 is returned.

       If x is positive infinity or negative infinity, a domain error  occurs,
       and a NaN is returned.

       If  x is outside the range [-1, 1], a domain error occurs, and a NaN is
       returned.

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an  error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Domain error: x is outside the range [-1, 1]
              errno  is  set  to  EDOM.   An  invalid floating-point exception
              (FE_INVALID) is raised.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.  The variant returning double also conforms to SVr4,
       4.3BSD, C89.
