GAMMA(3)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  GAMMA(3)



NAME
       gamma, gammaf, gammal - (logarithm of the) gamma function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double gamma(double x);
       float gammaf(float x);
       long double gammal(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       gamma():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE
       gammaf(), gammal():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600

DESCRIPTION
       These  functions  are  deprecated: instead, use either the tgamma(3) or
       the lgamma(3) functions, as appropriate.

       For the definition of the Gamma function, see tgamma(3).

   *BSD version
       The libm in 4.4BSD and some versions of FreeBSD had a gamma()  function
       that computes the Gamma function, as one would expect.

   glibc version
       Glibc  has  a gamma() function that is equivalent to lgamma(3) and com‐
       putes the natural logarithm of the Gamma function.

RETURN VALUE
       See lgamma(3).

ERRORS
       See lgamma(3).

CONFORMING TO
       Because of historical variations in behavior across systems, this func‐
       tion is not specified in any standard.

NOTES
   History
       4.2BSD  had  a gamma() that computed ln(|Gamma(|x|)|), leaving the sign
       of Gamma(|x|) in the external integer signgam.  In 4.3BSD the name  was
       changed to lgamma(3), and the man page promises

           "At  some  time  in the future the name gamma will be rehabilitated
           and used for the Gamma function"

       This did indeed happen in 4.4BSD,  where  gamma()  computes  the  Gamma
       function (with no effect on signgam).  However, this came too late, and
       we now have tgamma(3), the "true gamma" function.
