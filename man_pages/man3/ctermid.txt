NAME
       ctermid - get controlling terminal name

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       char *ctermid(char *s);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       ctermid(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE || _POSIX_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       ctermid()  returns  a string which is the pathname for the current con‐
       trolling terminal for this process.  If s is NULL, a static  buffer  is
       used,  otherwise  s  points to a buffer used to hold the terminal path‐
       name.  The symbolic constant L_ctermid is the maximum number of charac‐
       ters in the returned pathname.

RETURN VALUE
       The pointer to the pathname.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The  ctermid()  function  is  thread-safe  with  exceptions.  It is not
       thread-safe if called with a NULL parameter.

CONFORMING TO
       Svr4, POSIX.1-2001.

BUGS
       The path returned may not uniquely identify the  controlling  terminal;
       it may, for example, be /dev/tty.

       It is not assured that the program can open the terminal.
