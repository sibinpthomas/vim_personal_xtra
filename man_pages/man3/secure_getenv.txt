GETENV(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 GETENV(3)



NAME
       getenv - get an environment variable

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *getenv(const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
       The  getenv()  function searches the environment list to find the envi‐
       ronment variable name, and returns a pointer to the corresponding value
       string.

RETURN VALUE
       The  getenv()  function  returns a pointer to the value in the environ‐
       ment, or NULL if there is no match.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.

NOTES
       The strings in the environment list are of the form name=value.

       As typically implemented, getenv() returns a pointer to a string within
       the  environment  list.   The  caller must take care not to modify this
       string, since that would change the environment of the process.

       The implementation of getenv() is not required to  be  reentrant.   The
       string  pointed  to  by  the return value of getenv() may be statically
       allocated, and can be  modified  by  a  subsequent  call  to  getenv(),
       putenv(3), setenv(3), or unsetenv(3).
