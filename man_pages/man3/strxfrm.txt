STRXFRM(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                STRXFRM(3)



NAME
       strxfrm - string transformation

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       size_t strxfrm(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strxfrm() function transforms the src string into a form such that
       the result of strcmp(3) on two strings that have been transformed  with
       strxfrm()  is  the  same as the result of strcoll(3) on the two strings
       before their transformation.  The first  n  bytes  of  the  transformed
       string  are  placed  in  dest.  The transformation is based on the pro‚Äê
       gram's current locale for category LC_COLLATE.  (See setlocale(3)).

RETURN VALUE
       The strxfrm() function returns the number of bytes  required  to  store
       the  transformed  string  in  dest  excluding the terminating null byte
       ('\0').  If the value returned is n or more, the contents of  dest  are
       indeterminate.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.

NOTES
       In the POSIX or C locales strxfrm() is equivalent to copying the string
       with strncpy(3).
