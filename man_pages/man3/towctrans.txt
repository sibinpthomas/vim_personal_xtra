TOWCTRANS(3)               Linux Programmer's Manual              TOWCTRANS(3)



NAME
       towctrans - wide-character transliteration

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wint_t towctrans(wint_t wc, wctrans_t desc);

DESCRIPTION
       If  wc  is  a  wide  character,  the towctrans() function translates it
       according to the transliteration descriptor desc.  If wc is WEOF,  WEOF
       is returned.

       desc  must  be  a transliteration descriptor returned by the wctrans(3)
       function.

RETURN VALUE
       The towctrans() function returns the translated wide character, or WEOF
       if wc is WEOF.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The  behavior  of  towctrans()  depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
       current locale.
