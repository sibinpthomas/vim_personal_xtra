       float complex cerff(float complex z);
       long double complex cerfl(long double complex z);

DESCRIPTION
       The (unimplemented) function cerf() is the complex version of the error
       function.  erf(z) = 2/sqrt(pi) * integral from 0 to z of exp(-t*t)  dt.
       The function cerfc() is defined as cerfc(z) = 1-cerf(z).

CONFORMING TO
       The function names are reserved for future use in C99.
