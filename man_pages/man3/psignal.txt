PSIGNAL(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                PSIGNAL(3)



NAME
       psignal, psiginfo - print signal message

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       void psignal(int sig, const char *s);
       void psiginfo(const siginfo_t *pinfo, const char *s);

       extern const char *const sys_siglist[];

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       psignal(): _SVID_SOURCE || _BSD_SOURCE
       psiginfo(): _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
       sys_siglist: _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  psignal()  function displays a message on stderr consisting of the
       string s, a colon, a space, a string describing the signal number  sig,
       and  a  trailing  newline.  If the string s is NULL or empty, the colon
       and space are omitted.  If sig is invalid, the message  displayed  will
       indicate an unknown signal.

       The  psiginfo()  function  is  like  psignal(), except that it displays
       information about the signal described by pinfo, which should point  to
       a  valid siginfo_t structure.  As well as the signal description, psig‚Äê
       info() displays information about the origin of the signal,  and  other
       information  relevant  to the signal (e.g., the relevant memory address
       for hardware-generated signals, the child process ID for  SIGCHLD,  and
       the user ID and process ID of the sender, for signals set using kill(2)
       or sigqueue(3)).

       The array sys_siglist holds the signal description strings  indexed  by
       signal number.

RETURN VALUE
       The psignal() and psiginfo() functions return no value.

VERSIONS
       The psiginfo() function was added to glibc in version 2.10.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008, 4.3BSD.

BUGS
       In glibc versions up to 2.12, psiginfo() had the following bugs:

       *  In some circumstances, a trailing newline is not printed.

       *  Additional details are not displayed for real-time signals.
