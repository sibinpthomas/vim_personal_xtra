CARG(3)                    Linux Programmer's Manual                   CARG(3)



NAME
       carg, cargf, cargl - calculate the complex argument

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double carg(double complex z);
       float cargf(float complex z);
       long double cargl(long double complex z);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       A complex number can be described by two real coordinates.  One may use
       rectangular coordinates and gets

           z = x + I * y

       where x = creal(z) and y = cimag(z).

       Or one may use polar coordinates and gets

           z = r * cexp(I * a)

       where r = cabs(z) is the "radius", the "modulus", the absolute value of
       z, and a = carg(z) is the "phase angle", the argument of z.

       One has:

           tan(carg(z)) = cimag(z) / creal(z)

RETURN VALUE
       The return value is the range of [-pi,pi].

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
