FGETWC(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 FGETWC(3)



NAME
       fgetwc, getwc - read a wide character from a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t fgetwc(FILE *stream);
       wint_t getwc(FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fgetwc() function is the wide-character equivalent of the fgetc(3)
       function.  It reads a wide character from stream and  returns  it.   If
       the  end  of  stream  is reached, or if ferror(stream) becomes true, it
       returns WEOF.  If a wide-character conversion  error  occurs,  it  sets
       errno to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.

       The  getwc()  function  or macro functions identically to fgetwc().  It
       may be implemented as a macro, and may evaluate its argument more  than
       once.  There is no reason ever to use it.

       For nonlocking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The  fgetwc() function returns the next wide-character from the stream,
       or WEOF.

ERRORS
       Apart from the usual ones, there is

       EILSEQ The data obtained from the input stream does not  form  a  valid
              character.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The  behavior  of fgetwc() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur‚Äê
       rent locale.

       In the absence of additional information passed to the  fopen(3)  call,
       it is reasonable to expect that fgetwc() will actually read a multibyte
       sequence from the stream and then convert it to a wide character.
