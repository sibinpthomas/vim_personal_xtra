NAME
       wcscat - concatenate two wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcscat(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcscat() function is the wide-character equivalent of the strcat(3)
       function.  It copies the  wide-character  string  pointed  to  by  src,
       including  the  terminating  null wide character (L'\0'), to the end of
       the wide-character string pointed to by dest.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The  programmer  must  ensure  that  there  is  room   for   at   least
       wcslen(dest)+wcslen(src)+1 wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcscat() returns dest.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The wcscat() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
