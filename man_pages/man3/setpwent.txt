GETPWENT(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               GETPWENT(3)



NAME
       getpwent, setpwent, endpwent - get password file entry

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <pwd.h>

       struct passwd *getpwent(void);

       void setpwent(void);

       void endpwent(void);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       getpwent(), setpwent(), endpwent():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 ||
           _XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

DESCRIPTION
       The getpwent() function returns a pointer to a structure containing the
       broken-out  fields  of  a  record from the password database (e.g., the
       local password file /etc/passwd, NIS, and LDAP).  The first time  getp‐
       went()  is  called,  it returns the first entry; thereafter, it returns
       successive entries.

       The setpwent() function rewinds to the beginning of the password  data‐
       base.

       The  endpwent()  function  is used to close the password database after
       all processing has been performed.

       The passwd structure is defined in <pwd.h> as follows:

           struct passwd {
               char   *pw_name;       /* username */
               char   *pw_passwd;     /* user password */
               uid_t   pw_uid;        /* user ID */
               gid_t   pw_gid;        /* group ID */
               char   *pw_gecos;      /* user information */
               char   *pw_dir;        /* home directory */
               char   *pw_shell;      /* shell program */
           };

       When  shadow(5)  passwords  are  enabled  (which  is  default  on  many
       GNU/Linux  installations)  the content of pw_passwd is usually not very
       useful.  In such a case most passwords are stored in a separate file.

       The variable pw_shell may be empty, in which case the system will  exe‐
       cute the default shell (/bin/sh) for the user.

       For more information about the fields of this structure, see passwd(5).

RETURN VALUE
       The  getpwent()  function  returns  a pointer to a passwd structure, or
       NULL if there are no more entries or an error  occured.   If  an  error
       occurs,  errno is set appropriately.  If one wants to check errno after
       the call, it should be set to zero before the call.

       The return value may point to a static area, and may be overwritten  by
       subsequent  calls  to getpwent(), getpwnam(3), or getpwuid(3).  (Do not
       pass the returned pointer to free(3).)

ERRORS
       EINTR  A signal was caught.

       EIO    I/O error.

       EMFILE The maximum number (OPEN_MAX) of files was open already  in  the
              calling process.

       ENFILE The maximum number of files was open already in the system.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to allocate passwd structure.

       ERANGE Insufficient buffer space supplied.

FILES
       /etc/passwd
              local password database file

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4,  4.3BSD,  POSIX.1-2001.   The  pw_gecos field is not specified in
       POSIX, but is present on most implementations.
