GETUTMP(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                GETUTMP(3)



NAME
       getutmp, getutmpx - copy utmp structure to utmpx, and vice versa

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <utmpx.h>

        void getutmp(const struct utmpx *ux, struct utmp *u);
        void getutmpx(const struct utmp *u, struct utmpx *ux);

DESCRIPTION
       The getutmp() function copies the fields of the utmpx structure pointed
       to by ux to the corresponding fields of the utmp structure  pointed  to
       by u.  The getutmpx() function performs the converse operation.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions do not return a value.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.1.

CONFORMING TO
       These  functions  are  nonstandard,  but appear on a few other systems,
       such as Solaris and NetBSD.

NOTES
       These functions exist primarily for compatibility  with  other  systems
       where  the  utmp  and utmpx structures contain different fields, or the
       size of corresponding fields differs.  On  Linux,  the  two  structures
       contain the same fields, and the fields have the same sizes.
