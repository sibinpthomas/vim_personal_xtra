NAME
       toascii - convert character to ASCII

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ctype.h>

       int toascii(int c);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       toascii(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       toascii()  converts c to a 7-bit unsigned char value that fits into the
       ASCII character set, by clearing the high-order bits.

RETURN VALUE
       The value returned is that of the converted character.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, BSD, POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2008  marks  toascii()  as  obsolete,
       noting that it cannot be use portably in a localized application.

BUGS
       Many  people  will  be unhappy if you use this function.  This function
       will convert accented letters into random characters.
