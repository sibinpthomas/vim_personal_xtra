TOWUPPER(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               TOWUPPER(3)



NAME
       towupper - convert a wide character to uppercase

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wint_t towupper(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  towupper()  function is the wide-character equivalent of the toup‐
       per(3) function.  If wc is a wide character, it is converted to  upper‐
       case.  Characters which do not have case are returned unchanged.  If wc
       is WEOF, WEOF is returned.

RETURN VALUE
       The towupper() function returns the uppercase equivalent of wc, or WEOF
       if wc is WEOF.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of towupper() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur‐
       rent locale.

       This function is not very appropriate for dealing with Unicode  charac‐
       ters,  because  Unicode knows about three cases: upper, lower and title
       case.
