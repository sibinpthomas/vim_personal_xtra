GETLOADAVG(3)              Linux Programmer's Manual             GETLOADAVG(3)



NAME
       getloadavg - get system load averages

SYNOPSIS
       #define _BSD_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int getloadavg(double loadavg[], int nelem);

DESCRIPTION
       The getloadavg() function returns the number of processes in the system
       run queue averaged over various periods of time.  Up to  nelem  samples
       are  retrieved  and  assigned to successive elements of loadavg[].  The
       system imposes a maximum of 3 samples, representing averages  over  the
       last 1, 5, and 15 minutes, respectively.

RETURN VALUE
       If  the  load  average was unobtainable, -1 is returned; otherwise, the
       number of samples actually retrieved is returned.

VERSIONS
       This function is available in glibc since version 2.2.
