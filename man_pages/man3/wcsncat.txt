WCSNCAT(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                WCSNCAT(3)



NAME
       wcsncat - concatenate two wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcsncat(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wcsncat()  function  is the wide-character equivalent of the strn‚Äê
       cat(3) function.  It copies at most n wide characters  from  the  wide-
       character  string  pointed  to  by src to the end of the wide-character
       string pointed to by dest, and adds a terminating null  wide  character
       (L'\0').

       The strings may not overlap.

       The   programmer   must   ensure  that  there  is  room  for  at  least
       wcslen(dest)+n+1 wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcsncat() returns dest.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The wcsncat() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
