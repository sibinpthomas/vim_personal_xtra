SINH(3)                    Linux Programmer's Manual                   SINH(3)



NAME
       sinh, sinhf, sinhl - hyperbolic sine function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double sinh(double x);
       float sinhf(float x);
       long double sinhl(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       sinhf(), sinhl():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 ||
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The sinh() function returns the hyperbolic sine of x, which is  defined
       mathematically as:

           sinh(x) = (exp(x) - exp(-x)) / 2

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the hyperbolic sine of x.

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is +0 (-0), +0 (-0) is returned.

       If x is positive infinity (negative infinity), positive infinity (nega‚Äê
       tive infinity) is returned.

       If the result overflows, a range error occurs, and the functions return
       HUGE_VAL,  HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL, respectively, with the same sign as
       x.

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an  error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Range error: result overflow
              errno  is  set  to ERANGE.  An overflow floating-point exception
              (FE_OVERFLOW) is raised.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.  The variant returning double also conforms to SVr4,
       4.3BSD, C89.
