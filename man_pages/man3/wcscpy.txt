NAME
       wcscpy - copy a wide-character string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcscpy(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcscpy() function is the wide-character equivalent of the strcpy(3)
       function.  It copies the  wide-character  string  pointed  to  by  src,
       including  the  terminating  null  wide character (L'\0'), to the array
       pointed to by dest.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The  programmer  must  ensure  that  there  is  room   for   at   least
       wcslen(src)+1 wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcscpy() returns dest.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The wcscpy() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
