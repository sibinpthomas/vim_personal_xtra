MKFIFOAT(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               MKFIFOAT(3)



NAME
       mkfifoat  -  make  a  FIFO  (named  pipe)  relative to a directory file
       descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fcntl.h> /* Definition of AT_* constants */
       #include <sys/stat.h>

       int mkfifoat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, mode_t mode);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       mkfifoat():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _ATFILE_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The mkfifoat()  system  call  operates  in  exactly  the  same  way  as
       mkfifo(3), except for the differences described in this manual page.

       If  the  pathname given in pathname is relative, then it is interpreted
       relative to the directory referred to  by  the  file  descriptor  dirfd
       (rather  than  relative to the current working directory of the calling
       process, as is done by mkfifo(3) for a relative pathname).

       If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value  AT_FDCWD,  then
       pathname  is  interpreted  relative to the current working directory of
       the calling process (like mkfifo(3)).

       If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, mkfifoat() returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned  and  errno
       is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The same errors that occur for mkfifo(3) can also occur for mkfifoat().
       The following additional errors can occur for mkfifoat():

       EBADF  dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOTDIR
              pathname is a relative path  and  dirfd  is  a  file  descriptor
              referring to a file other than a directory.

VERSIONS
       mkfifoat()  was added to glibc in version 2.4.  It is implemented using
       mknod(2), available on Linux since kernel 2.6.16.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for mkfifoat().
