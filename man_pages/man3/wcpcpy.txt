WCPCPY(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 WCPCPY(3)



NAME
       wcpcpy - copy a wide-character string, returning a pointer to its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcpcpy(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       wcpcpy():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The wcpcpy() function is the wide-character equivalent of the stpcpy(3)
       function.  It copies the  wide-character  string  pointed  to  by  src,
       including  the  terminating  null  wide character (L'\0'), to the array
       pointed to by dest.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The  programmer  must  ensure  that  there  is  room   for   at   least
       wcslen(src)+1 wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcpcpy()  returns  a  pointer  to  the end of the wide-character string
       dest, that is, a pointer to the terminating null wide character.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The wcpcpy() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.
