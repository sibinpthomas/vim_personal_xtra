SINCOS(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 SINCOS(3)



NAME
       sincos, sincosf, sincosl - calculate sin and cos simultaneously

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <math.h>

       void sincos(double x, double *sin, double *cos);
       void sincosf(float x, float *sin, float *cos);
       void sincosl(long double x, long double *sin, long double *cos);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       Several  applications  need  sine and cosine of the same angle x.  This
       function computes both at the same time, and stores the results in *sin
       and *cos.

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned in *sin and *cos.

       If  x is positive infinity or negative infinity, a domain error occurs,
       and a NaN is returned in *sin and *cos.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return void.

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an  error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Domain error: x is an infinity
              An invalid floating-point exception (FE_INVALID) is raised.

       These functions do not set errno.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.
