POSIX_OPENPT(3)            Linux Programmer's Manual           POSIX_OPENPT(3)



NAME
       posix_openpt - open a pseudoterminal device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>
       #include <fcntl.h>

       int posix_openpt(int flags);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       posix_openpt(): _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600

DESCRIPTION
       The  posix_openpt()  function  opens  an  unused  pseudoterminal master
       device, returning a file descriptor that can be used to refer  to  that
       device.

       The  flags argument is a bit mask that ORs together zero or more of the
       following flags:

       O_RDWR Open the device for both reading and writing.  It  is  usual  to
              specify this flag.

       O_NOCTTY
              Do  not  make  this  device  the  controlling  terminal  for the
              process.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, posix_openpt() returns a nonnegative file descriptor  which
       is  the lowest numbered unused descriptor.  On failure, -1 is returned,
       and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       See open(2).

VERSIONS
       Glibc support for posix_openpt() has been provided since version 2.2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       posix_openpt() is part of  the  UNIX  98  pseudoterminal  support  (see
       pts(4)).  This function is specified in POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The  posix_openpt() function is a recent invention in POSIX.  Some UNIX
       implementations that support System V  (aka  UNIX  98)  pseudoterminals
       don't have this function, but it is easy to implement:

           int
           posix_openpt(int flags)
           {
               return open("/dev/ptmx", flags);
           }

       Calling  posix_openpt()  creates a pathname for the corresponding pseu‚Äê
       doterminal slave device.  The pathname  of  the  slave  device  can  be
       obtained  using  ptsname(3).   The slave device pathname exists only as
       long as the master device is open.
