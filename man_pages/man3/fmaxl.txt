SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double fmax(double x, double y);
       float fmaxf(float x, float y);
       long double fmaxl(long double x, long double y);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fmax(), fmaxf(), fmaxl():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE ||
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       These functions return the larger value of x and y.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return the maximum of x and y.

       If one argument is a NaN, the other argument is returned.

       If both arguments are NaN, a NaN is returned.
