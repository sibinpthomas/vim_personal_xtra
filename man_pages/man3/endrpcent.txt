GETRPCENT(3)               Linux Programmer's Manual              GETRPCENT(3)



NAME
       getrpcent, getrpcbyname, getrpcbynumber, setrpcent, endrpcent - get RPC
       entry

SYNOPSIS
       #include <netdb.h>

       struct rpcent *getrpcent(void);

       struct rpcent *getrpcbyname(char *name);

       struct rpcent *getrpcbynumber(int number);

       void setrpcent(int stayopen);

       void endrpcent(void);

DESCRIPTION
       getrpcent(), getrpcbyname(), and getrpcbynumber() each return a pointer
       to  an  object  with  the following structure containing the broken-out
       fields of an entry in the RPC program number data base.

           struct rpcent {
               char  *r_name;     /* name of server for this RPC program */
               char **r_aliases;  /* alias list */
               long   r_number;   /* RPC program number */
           };

       The members of this structure are:

           r_name      The name of the server for this RPC program.

           r_aliases   A NULL-terminated list of alternate names for  the  RPC
                       program.

           r_number    The RPC program number for this service.

       getrpcent()  reads  the  next entry from the database.  A connection is
       opened to the database if necessary.

       setrpcent() function opens a connection to the database, and  sets  the
       next  entry  to the first entry.  If stayopen is nonzero, then the con‐
       nection to the database will not be closed between calls to one of  the
       getrpc*() functions.

       The endrpcent() function closes the connection to the database.

       getrpcbyname() and getrpcbynumber() sequentially search from the begin‐
       ning of the file until a matching RPC program name or program number is
       found, or until end-of-file is encountered.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, getrpcent(), getrpcbyname(), and getrpcbynumber() return a
       pointer to a statically allocated rpcent structure.  A NULL pointer  is
       returned on EOF or error.

FILES
       /etc/rpc
              RPC program number database.

CONFORMING TO
       Not in POSIX.1-2001.  Present on the BSDs, Solaris, and many other sys‐
       tems.

BUGS
       All information is contained in a static area so it must be  copied  if
       it is to be saved.
