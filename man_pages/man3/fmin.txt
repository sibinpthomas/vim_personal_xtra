NAME
       fmin, fminf, fminl - determine minimum of two floating-point numbers

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double fmin(double x, double y);
       float fminf(float x, float y);
       long double fminl(long double x, long double y);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fmin(), fminf(), fminl():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE ||
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       These functions return the lesser value of x and y.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return the minimum of x and y.

       If one argument is a NaN, the other argument is returned.

       If both arguments are NaN, a NaN is returned.

ERRORS
       No errors occur.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The fmin(), fminf(), and fminl() functions are thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.
