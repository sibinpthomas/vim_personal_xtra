CPROJ(3)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  CPROJ(3)



NAME
       cproj, cprojf, cprojl - project into Riemann Sphere

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double complex cproj(double complex z);
       float complex cprojf(float complex z);
       long double complex cprojl(long double complex z);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       These functions project a point in the plane onto the surface of a Rie‚Äê
       mann Sphere, the one-point compactification of the complex plane.  Each
       finite  point  z projects to z itself.  Every complex infinite value is
       projected to a single infinite value, namely to  positive  infinity  on
       the real axis.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The cproj(), cprojf(), and cprojl() functions are thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       In  glibc 2.11 and earlier, the implementation does something different
       (a stereographic projection onto a Riemann Sphere).
