STRCOLL(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                STRCOLL(3)



NAME
       strcoll - compare two strings using the current locale

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       int strcoll(const char *s1, const char *s2);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strcoll() function compares the two strings s1 and s2.  It returns
       an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if  s1  is  found,
       respectively,  to  be  less than, to match, or be greater than s2.  The
       comparison is based on strings interpreted as appropriate for the  pro‚Äê
       gram's current locale for category LC_COLLATE.  (See setlocale(3).)

RETURN VALUE
       The  strcoll()  function  returns  an  integer  less than, equal to, or
       greater than zero if s1 is found, respectively, to  be  less  than,  to
       match,  or be greater than s2, when both are interpreted as appropriate
       for the current locale.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.

NOTES
       In the POSIX or C locales strcoll() is equivalent to strcmp(3).
