WMEMCPY(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                WMEMCPY(3)



NAME
       wmemcpy - copy an array of wide-characters

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wmemcpy(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wmemcpy()  function  is  the wide-character equivalent of the mem‐
       cpy(3) function.  It copies n wide characters from the  array  starting
       at src to the array starting at dest.

       The arrays may not overlap; use wmemmove(3) to copy between overlapping
       arrays.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide char‐
       acters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wmemcpy() returns dest.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The wmemcpy() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
