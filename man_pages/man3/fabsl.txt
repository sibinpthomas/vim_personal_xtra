NAME
       fabs, fabsf, fabsl - absolute value of floating-point number

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double fabs(double x);
       float fabsf(float x);
       long double fabsl(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fabsf(), fabsl():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 ||
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The fabs() functions return the absolute value  of  the  floating-point
       number x.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return the absolute value of x.

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is -0, +0 is returned.

       If  x  is  negative infinity or positive infinity, positive infinity is
       returned.

ERRORS
       No errors occur.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.  The variant returning double also conforms to SVr4,
       4.3BSD, C89.
