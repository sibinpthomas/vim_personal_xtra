SIGPAUSE(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               SIGPAUSE(3)



NAME
       sigpause - atomically release blocked signals and wait for interrupt

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int sigpause(int sigmask);  /* BSD */

       int sigpause(int sig);      /* System V / UNIX 95 */

DESCRIPTION
       Don't use this function.  Use sigsuspend(2) instead.

       The  function  sigpause()  is  designed  to  wait  for some signal.  It
       changes the process's signal mask (set of blocked  signals),  and  then
       waits  for  a signal to arrive.  Upon arrival of a signal, the original
       signal mask is restored.

RETURN VALUE
       If sigpause() returns, it was interrupted by a signal  and  the  return
       value is -1 with errno set to EINTR.

CONFORMING TO
       The System V version of sigpause() is standardized in POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
   History
       The classical BSD version of this function appeared in 4.2BSD.  It sets
       the process's signal mask to sigmask.  UNIX 95 standardized the  incom‐
       patible System V version of this function, which removes only the spec‐
       ified signal sig from the process's signal mask.  The unfortunate situ‐
       ation  with two incompatible functions with the same name was solved by
       the sigsuspend(2) function, that takes a sigset_t *  argument  (instead
       of an int).

   Linux notes
       On  Linux,  this  routine  is a system call only on the Sparc (sparc64)
       architecture.

       Libc4 and libc5 know only about the BSD version.

       Glibc uses the BSD version if the _BSD_SOURCE  feature  test  macro  is
       defined  and  none  of  _POSIX_SOURCE,  _POSIX_C_SOURCE, _XOPEN_SOURCE,
       _GNU_SOURCE, or _SVID_SOURCE is defined.  Otherwise, the System V  ver‐
       sion is used.
