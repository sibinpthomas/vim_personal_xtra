WCRTOMB(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                WCRTOMB(3)



NAME
       wcrtomb - convert a wide character to a multibyte sequence

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t wcrtomb(char *s, wchar_t wc, mbstate_t *ps);

DESCRIPTION
       The  main  case for this function is when s is not NULL and wc is not a
       null wide character (L'\0').  In this case, the wcrtomb() function con‐
       verts  the wide character wc to its multibyte representation and stores
       it at the beginning of the character array pointed to by s.  It updates
       the shift state *ps, and returns the length of said multibyte represen‐
       tation, that is, the number of bytes written at s.

       A different case is when s is not NULL, but wc is a null wide character
       (L'\0').   In  this case the wcrtomb() function stores at the character
       array pointed to by s the shift sequence needed to bring  *ps  back  to
       the initial state, followed by a '\0' byte.  It updates the shift state
       *ps (i.e., brings it into the initial state), and returns the length of
       the shift sequence plus one, that is, the number of bytes written at s.

       A  third  case  is when s is NULL.  In this case wc is ignored, and the
       function effectively returns

           wcrtomb(buf, L'\0', ps)

       where buf is an internal anonymous buffer.

       In all of the above cases, if ps is a NULL pointer, a static  anonymous
       state known only to the wcrtomb() function is used instead.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcrtomb()  function  returns the number of bytes that have been or
       would have been written to the byte array at s.  If wc can not be  rep‐
       resented  as  a  multibyte  sequence (according to the current locale),
       (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno set to EILSEQ.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of wcrtomb() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the  cur‐
       rent locale.

       Passing NULL as ps is not multithread safe.
