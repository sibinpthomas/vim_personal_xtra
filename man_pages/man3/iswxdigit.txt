ISWXDIGIT(3)               Linux Programmer's Manual              ISWXDIGIT(3)



NAME
       iswxdigit - test for hexadecimal digit wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswxdigit(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswxdigit()  function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of the
       isxdigit(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character  belong‐
       ing to the wide-character class "xdigit".

       The  wide-character  class "xdigit" is a subclass of the wide-character
       class "alnum", and therefore also  a  subclass  of  the  wide-character
       class "graph" and of the wide-character class "print".

       Being  a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-charac‐
       ter class "xdigit" is disjoint from the wide-character class "cntrl".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the  wide-charac‐
       ter  class  "xdigit"  is disjoint from the wide-character class "space"
       and its subclass "blank".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the  wide-charac‐
       ter class "xdigit" is disjoint from the wide-character class "punct".

       The  wide-character class "xdigit" always contains at least the letters
       'A' to 'F', 'a' to 'f' and the digits '0' to '9'.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswxdigit() function returns nonzero if  wc  is  a  wide  character
       belonging  to  the wide-character class "xdigit".  Otherwise it returns
       zero.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswxdigit() depends on the  LC_CTYPE  category  of  the
       current locale.
