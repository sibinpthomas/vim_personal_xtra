NAME
       conj, conjf, conjl - calculate the complex conjugate

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double complex conj(double complex z);
       float complex conjf(float complex z);
       long double complex conjl(long double complex z);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       The  conj() function returns the complex conjugate value of z.  That is
       the value obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary part.

       One has:

           cabs(z) = csqrt(z * conj(z))

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The conj(), conjf(), and conjl() functions are thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
