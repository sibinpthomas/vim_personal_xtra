ILOGB(3)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  ILOGB(3)



NAME
       ilogb, ilogbf, ilogbl - get integer exponent of a floating-point value

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       int ilogb(double x);
       int ilogbf(float x);
       int ilogbl(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       ilogb():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 ||
           _XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED || _ISOC99_SOURCE ||
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99
       ilogbf(), ilogbl():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 ||
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       These functions return the exponent part of their argument as a  signed
       integer.   When  no error occurs, these functions are equivalent to the
       corresponding logb(3) functions, cast to int.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the exponent of x, as a signed inte‚Äê
       ger.

       If  x  is  zero,  then  a domain error occurs, and the functions return
       FP_ILOGB0.

       If x is a NaN, then a domain error occurs,  and  the  functions  return
       FP_ILOGBNAN.

       If  x  is  negative  infinity or positive infinity, then a domain error
       occurs, and the functions return INT_MAX.

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an  error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Domain error: x is 0 or a NaN
              An invalid floating-point exception (FE_INVALID) is raised.

              These functions do not set errno for this case.

       Domain error: x is an infinity

              These  functions do not set errno or raise an exception for this
              case.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.
