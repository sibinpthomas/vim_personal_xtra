ADDSEVERITY(3)             Linux Programmer's Manual            ADDSEVERITY(3)



NAME
       addseverity - introduce new severity classes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fmtmsg.h>

       int addseverity(int severity, const char *s);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       addseverity(): _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       This function allows the introduction of new severity classes which can
       be addressed by the severity argument of the  fmtmsg(3)  function.   By
       default  that  latter  function  only  knows  how to print messages for
       severity 0-4 (with strings (none), HALT, ERROR, WARNING,  INFO).   This
       call  attaches the given string s to the given value severity.  If s is
       NULL, the severity class with the numeric value  severity  is  removed.
       It  is  not possible to overwrite or remove one of the default severity
       classes.  The severity value must be nonnegative.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon success, the value MM_OK is  returned.   Upon  error,  the  return
       value  is MM_NOTOK.  Possible errors include: out of memory, attempt to
       remove a nonexistent or default severity class.

VERSIONS
       addseverity() is provided in glibc since version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is not specified in the X/Open Portability Guide although
       the fmtmsg(3) function is.  It is available on System V systems.

NOTES
       New severity classes can also be added by setting the environment vari‚Äê
       able SEV_LEVEL.
