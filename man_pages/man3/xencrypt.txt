XCRYPT(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 XCRYPT(3)



NAME
       xencrypt, xdecrypt, passwd2des - RFS password encryption

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rpc/des_crypt.h>

       void passwd2des(char *passwd, char *key);

       int xencrypt(char *secret, char *passwd);

       int xdecrypt(char *secret, char *passwd);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function passwd2des() takes a character string passwd of arbitrary
       length and fills a character array key of length 8.  The array  key  is
       suitable  for  use  as DES key.  It has odd parity set in bit 0 of each
       byte.  Both other functions described here use this  function  to  turn
       their argument passwd into a DES key.

       The  xencrypt()  function takes the ASCII character string secret given
       in hex, which must have a length that is a multiple of 16, encrypts  it
       using  the DES key derived from passwd by passwd2des(), and outputs the
       result again in secret as a hex string of the same length.

       The xdecrypt() function performs the converse operation.

RETURN VALUE
       The functions xencrypt() and xdecrypt() return 1 on success  and  0  on
       error.

VERSIONS
       These  routines  are present in libc 4.6.27 and later, and in glibc 2.1
       and later.

BUGS
       The prototypes are missing from the abovementioned include file.
