STPCPY(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 STPCPY(3)



NAME
       stpcpy - copy a string returning a pointer to its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *stpcpy(char *dest, const char *src);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       stpcpy():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  stpcpy()  function  copies the string pointed to by src (including
       the terminating null byte ('\0')) to the array pointed to by dest.  The
       strings  may not overlap, and the destination string dest must be large
       enough to receive the copy.

RETURN VALUE
       stpcpy() returns a pointer to the end of the string dest (that is,  the
       address of the terminating null byte) rather than the beginning.

CONFORMING TO
       This  function was added to POSIX.1-2008.  Before that, it was not part
       of the C or POSIX.1 standards, nor customary on UNIX systems,  but  was
       not  a  GNU invention either.  Perhaps it came from MS-DOS.  It is also
       present on the BSDs.

BUGS
       This function may overrun the buffer dest.

EXAMPLE
       For example, this program uses stpcpy() to concatenate foo and  bar  to
       produce foobar, which it then prints.

           #define _GNU_SOURCE
           #include <string.h>
           #include <stdio.h>

           int
           main(void)
           {
               char buffer[20];
               char *to = buffer;

               to = stpcpy(to, "foo");
               to = stpcpy(to, "bar");
               printf("%s\n", buffer);
           }
