NAME
       swab - swap adjacent bytes

SYNOPSIS
       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE       /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <unistd.h>

       void swab(const void *from, void *to, ssize_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The swab() function copies n bytes from the array pointed to by from to
       the array pointed to by to, exchanging adjacent  even  and  odd  bytes.
       This  function is used to exchange data between machines that have dif‚Äê
       ferent low/high byte ordering.

       This function does nothing when n is negative.  When n is positive  and
       odd, it handles n-1 bytes as above, and does something unspecified with
       the last byte.  (In other words, n should be even.)

RETURN VALUE
       The swab() function returns no value.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
