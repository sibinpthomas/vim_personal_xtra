PTHREAD_KILL(3)            Linux Programmer's Manual           PTHREAD_KILL(3)



NAME
       pthread_kill - send a signal to a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int pthread_kill(pthread_t thread, int sig);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_kill() function sends the signal sig to thread, a thread in
       the same process as the caller.  The signal is asynchronously  directed
       to thread.

       If  sig  is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking is still per‐
       formed; this can be used to check for the existence of a thread ID.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_kill() returns 0; on error,  it  returns  an  error
       number, and no signal is sent.

ERRORS
       EINVAL An invalid signal was specified.

       ESRCH  No thread with the ID thread could be found.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Signal dispositions are process-wide: if a signal handler is installed,
       the handler will be invoked in the thread thread, but if  the  disposi‐
       tion  of  the signal is "stop", "continue", or "terminate", this action
       will affect the whole process.
