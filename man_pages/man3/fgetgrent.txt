FGETGRENT(3)               Linux Programmer's Manual              FGETGRENT(3)



NAME
       fgetgrent - get group file entry

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <grp.h>

       struct group *fgetgrent(FILE *stream);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fgetgrent(): _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  fgetgrent()  function  returns a pointer to a structure containing
       the group information from the file referred to by stream.   The  first
       time  it  is  called it returns the first entry; thereafter, it returns
       successive entries.  The file referred to by stream must have the  same
       format as /etc/group (see group(5)).

       The group structure is defined in <grp.h> as follows:

           struct group {
               char   *gr_name;        /* group name */
               char   *gr_passwd;      /* group password */
               gid_t   gr_gid;         /* group ID */
               char  **gr_mem;         /* group members */
           };

RETURN VALUE
       The  fgetgrent()  function  returns  a pointer to a group structure, or
       NULL if there are no more entries or an error occurs.  In the event  of
       an error, errno is set to indicate the cause.

ERRORS
       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to allocate group structure.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4.
