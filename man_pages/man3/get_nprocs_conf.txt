GET_NPROCS(3)              Linux Programmer's Manual             GET_NPROCS(3)



NAME
       get_nprocs, get_nprocs_conf - get number of processors

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/sysinfo.h>

       int get_nprocs(void);
       int get_nprocs_conf(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The function get_nprocs_conf() returns the number of processors config‐
       ured by the operating system.

       The function get_nprocs() returns the number  of  processors  currently
       available  in the system.  This may be less than the number returned by
       get_nprocs_conf() because processors may be offline (e.g., on  hotplug‐
       gable systems).

RETURN VALUE
       As given in DESCRIPTION.

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are GNU extensions.

NOTES
       The  current  implementation  of  these  functions is rather expensive,
       since they open and parse files in the /sys filesystem each  time  they
       are called.

       The  following sysconf(3) calls make use of the functions documented on
       this page to return the same information.

           np = sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF);     /* processors configured */
           np = sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN);     /* processors available */

EXAMPLE
       The following example shows how get_nprocs() and get_nprocs_conf()  can
       be used.

       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <sys/sysinfo.h>

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           printf("This system has %d processors configured and "
                   "%d processors available.\n",
                   get_nprocs_conf(), get_nprocs());
           return 0;
       }
