NAME
       clog10, clog10f, clog10l - base-10 logarithm of a complex number

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <complex.h>

       double complex clog10(double complex z);
       float complex clog10f(float complex z);
       long double complex clog10l(long double complex z);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       The  call  clog10(z) is equivalent to clog(z)/log(10).  The other func‚Äê
       tions perform the same task for float and long double.

       Note that z close to zero will cause an overflow.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.  It is reserved  for  future  use  in
       C99.
