FPUTWS(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 FPUTWS(3)



NAME
       fputws - write a wide-character string to a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int fputws(const wchar_t *ws, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fputws() function is the wide-character equivalent of the fputs(3)
       function.  It writes the wide-character string starting at  ws,  up  to
       but  not  including  the  terminating  null  wide character (L'\0'), to
       stream.

       For a nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The fputws() function returns a nonnegative integer  if  the  operation
       was successful, or -1 to indicate an error.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The  behavior  of fputws() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur‐
       rent locale.

       In the absence of additional information passed to the  fopen(3)  call,
       it is reasonable to expect that fputws() will actually write the multi‐
       byte string corresponding to the wide-character string ws.
