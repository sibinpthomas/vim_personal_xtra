FSEEKO(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 FSEEKO(3)



NAME
       fseeko, ftello - seek to or report file position

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       int fseeko(FILE *stream, off_t offset, int whence);

       off_t ftello(FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fseeko()  and  ftello()  functions  are  identical to fseek(3) and
       ftell(3) (see fseek(3)), respectively, except that the offset  argument
       of  fseeko()  and the return value of ftello() is of type off_t instead
       of long.

       On many architectures both off_t and long are 32-bit types, but  compi‚Äê
       lation with

              #define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64

       will turn off_t into a 64-bit type.

RETURN VALUE
       On  successful  completion,  fseeko() returns 0, while ftello() returns
       the current offset.  Otherwise, -1 is returned  and  errno  is  set  to
       indicate the error.

ERRORS
       See the ERRORS in fseek(3).

CONFORMING TO
       SUSv2, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       These  functions  are  found  on  System  V-like systems.  They are not
       present in libc4, libc5, glibc 2.0 but are available since glibc 2.1.
