FGETWS(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 FGETWS(3)



NAME
       fgetws - read a wide-character string from a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *fgetws(wchar_t *ws, int n, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fgetws() function is the wide-character equivalent of the fgets(3)
       function.  It reads a string of at most n-1 wide  characters  into  the
       wide-character array pointed to by ws, and adds a terminating null wide
       character (L'\0').  It stops  reading  wide  characters  after  it  has
       encountered  and  stored  a newline wide character.  It also stops when
       end of stream is reached.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide char‐
       acters at ws.

       For a nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The fgetws() function, if successful, returns ws.  If end of stream was
       already reached or if an error occurred, it returns NULL.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The behavior of fgetws() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of  the  cur‐
       rent locale.

       In  the  absence of additional information passed to the fopen(3) call,
       it is reasonable to expect that fgetws() will actually read a multibyte
       string from the stream and then convert it to a wide-character string.

       This  function  is unreliable, because it does not permit to deal prop‐
       erly with null wide characters that may be present in the input.
