CLEARENV(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               CLEARENV(3)



NAME
       clearenv - clear the environment

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int clearenv(void);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       clearenv(): _SVID_SOURCE || _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  clearenv() function clears the environment of all name-value pairs
       and sets the value of the external variable environ to NULL.

RETURN VALUE
       The clearenv() function returns zero on success, and a nonzero value on
       failure.

VERSIONS
       Not in libc4, libc5.  In glibc since glibc 2.0.

CONFORMING TO
       Various  UNIX variants (DG/UX, HP-UX, QNX, ...).  POSIX.9 (bindings for
       FORTRAN77).  POSIX.1-1996 did not accept clearenv() and putenv(3),  but
       changed  its mind and scheduled these functions for some later issue of
       this  standard  (cf.  B.4.6.1).   However,   POSIX.1-2001   adds   only
       putenv(3), and rejected clearenv().

NOTES
       Used  in  security-conscious  applications.   If  it is unavailable the
       assignment

           environ = NULL;

       will probably do.

       The DG/UX and Tru64 man pages write: If environ has  been  modified  by
       anything  other than the putenv(3), getenv(3), or clearenv() functions,
       then clearenv() will return an error and the process  environment  will
       remain unchanged.
