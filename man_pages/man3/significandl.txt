SIGNIFICAND(3)             Linux Programmer's Manual            SIGNIFICAND(3)



NAME
       significand,  significandf,  significandl  -  get mantissa of floating-
       point number

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double significand(double x);
       float significandf(float x);
       long double significandl(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       significand(), significandf(), significandl():
           _SVID_SOURCE || _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The significand() function returns the mantissa  of  x  scaled  to  the
       range [1,2).  It is equivalent to

           scalb(x, (double) -ilogb(x))

       This  function  exists mainly for use in certain standardized tests for
       IEEE 754 conformance.

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are nonstandard; the double version is available  on  a
       number of other systems.
