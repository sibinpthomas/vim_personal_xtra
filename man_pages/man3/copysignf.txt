COPYSIGN(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               COPYSIGN(3)



NAME
       copysign, copysignf, copysignl - copy sign of a number

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double copysign(double x, double y);
       float copysignf(float x, float y);
       long double copysignl(long double x, long double y);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       copysign(), copysignf(), copysignl():
           _SVID_SOURCE || _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 ||
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The copysign() functions return a value whose  absolute  value  matches
       that of x, but whose sign bit matches that of y.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  these  functions  return a value whose magnitude is taken
       from x and whose sign is taken from y.

       If x is a NaN, a NaN with the sign bit of y is returned.

ERRORS
       No errors occur.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.  This function is defined in IEC 559 (and the appen‐
       dix with recommended functions in IEEE 754/IEEE 854).

NOTES
       On architectures where the floating-point formats are not IEEE 754 com‐
       pliant, the copysign() functions may treat a negative zero as positive.
