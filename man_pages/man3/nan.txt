NAN(3)                     Linux Programmer's Manual                    NAN(3)



NAME
       nan, nanf, nanl - return 'Not a Number'

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double nan(const char *tagp);
       float nanf(const char *tagp);
       long double nanl(const char *tagp);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       nan(), nanf(), nanl():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE ||
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       These functions return a representation (determined by tagp) of a quiet
       NaN.   If  the  implementation does not support quiet NaNs, these func‐
       tions return zero.

       The call nan("char-sequence") is equivalent to:

           strtod("NAN(char-sequence)", NULL);

       Similarly, calls to nanf() and nanl() are equivalent to analogous calls
       to strtof(3) and strtold(3).

       The  argument  tagp is used in an unspecified manner.  On IEEE 754 sys‐
       tems, there are many representations of NaN, and tagp selects one.   On
       other systems it may do nothing.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       C99,  POSIX.1-2001.  See also IEC 559 and the appendix with recommended
       functions in IEEE 754/IEEE 854.
