STRCASECMP(3)              Linux Programmer's Manual             STRCASECMP(3)



NAME
       strcasecmp, strncasecmp - compare two strings ignoring case

SYNOPSIS
       #include <strings.h>

       int strcasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);

       int strncasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strcasecmp() function compares the two strings s1 and s2, ignoring
       the case of the characters.  It returns an integer less than, equal to,
       or  greater than zero if s1 is found, respectively, to be less than, to
       match, or be greater than s2.

       The strncasecmp() function is similar,  except  it  compares  the  only
       first n bytes of s1.

RETURN VALUE
       The  strcasecmp()  and  strncasecmp()  functions return an integer less
       than, equal to, or greater than zero  if  s1  (or  the  first  n  bytes
       thereof)  is  found,  respectively,  to  be  less than, to match, or be
       greater than s2.

CONFORMING TO
       4.4BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
