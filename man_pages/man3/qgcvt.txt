QECVT(3)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  QECVT(3)



NAME
       qecvt, qfcvt, qgcvt - convert a floating-point number to a string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *qecvt(long double number, int ndigits, int *decpt, int *sign);

       char *qfcvt(long double number, int ndigits, int *decpt, int *sign);

       char *qgcvt(long double number, int ndigit, char *buf);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       qecvt(), qfcvt(), qgcvt(): _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  functions  qecvt(),  qfcvt() and qgcvt() are identical to ecvt(3),
       fcvt(3) and gcvt(3) respectively, except that they use  a  long  double
       argument number.  See ecvt(3) and gcvt(3).

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4.   Not  seen  in  most  common UNIX implementations, but occurs in
       SunOS.  Not supported by libc4 and libc5.  Supported by glibc.

NOTES
       These functions are obsolete.  Instead, sprintf(3) is recommended.
