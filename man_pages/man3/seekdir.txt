SEEKDIR(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                SEEKDIR(3)



NAME
       seekdir  - set the position of the next readdir() call in the directory
       stream.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <dirent.h>

       void seekdir(DIR *dirp, long loc);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       seekdir(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The seekdir() function sets the location in the directory  stream  from
       which  the next readdir(2) call will start.  The loc argument should be
       a value returned by a previous call to telldir(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The seekdir() function returns no value.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The seekdir() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       In glibc up to version 2.1.1, the type of the loc argument  was  off_t.
       POSIX.1-2001  specifies  long,  and  this  is the type used since glibc
       2.1.2.  See telldir(3) for information on why you should be careful  in
       making any assumptions about the value in this argument.
