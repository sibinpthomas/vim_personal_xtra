LOCALECONV(3)              Linux Programmer's Manual             LOCALECONV(3)



NAME
       localeconv - get numeric formatting information

SYNOPSIS
       #include <locale.h>

       struct lconv *localeconv(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The  localeconv()  function returns a pointer to a struct lconv for the
       current locale.  This structure is shown in locale(7), and contains all
       values  associated  with  the locale categories LC_NUMERIC and LC_MONE‐
       TARY.  Programs may also use the functions  printf(3)  and  strfmon(3),
       which behave according to the actual locale in use.

RETURN VALUE
       The  localeconv()  function  returns  a  pointer  to a filled in struct
       lconv.  This structure may be (in glibc, is) statically allocated,  and
       may be overwritten by subsequent calls.  According to POSIX, the caller
       should not modify the contents of  this  structure.   The  localeconv()
       function always succeeds.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The  localeconv()  function  is  not  thread-safe,  since  it returns a
       pointer to a structure which might be overwritten by subsequent calls.

CONFORMING TO
       C89, C99.

BUGS
       The printf(3) family of functions may or  may  not  honor  the  current
       locale.
