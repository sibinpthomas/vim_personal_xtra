NAME
       cexp, cexpf, cexpl - complex exponential function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double complex cexp(double complex z);
       float complex cexpf(float complex z);
       long double complex cexpl(long double complex z);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       The  function calculates e (2.71828..., the base of natural logarithms)
       raised to the power of z.

       One has:

           cexp(I * z) = ccos(z) + I * csin(z)

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
