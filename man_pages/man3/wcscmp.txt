NAME
       wcscmp - compare two wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcscmp(const wchar_t *s1, const wchar_t *s2);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcscmp() function is the wide-character equivalent of the strcmp(3)
       function.  It compares the wide-character string pointed to by  s1  and
       the wide-character string pointed to by s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcscmp() function returns zero if the wide-character strings at s1
       and s2 are equal.  It returns an integer greater than zero  if  at  the
       first  differing  position i, the corresponding wide-character s1[i] is
       greater than s2[i].  It returns an integer less than  zero  if  at  the
       first  differing  position i, the corresponding wide-character s1[i] is
       less than s2[i].

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The wcscmp() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
