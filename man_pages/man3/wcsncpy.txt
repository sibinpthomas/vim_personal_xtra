WCSNCPY(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                WCSNCPY(3)



NAME
       wcsncpy - copy a fixed-size string of wide characters

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcsncpy(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The   wcsncpy()  function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of  the
       strncpy(3) function.  It copies at most  n  wide  characters  from  the
       wide-character string pointed to by src, including the terminating null
       wide character (L'\0'), to the array pointed to  by  dest.   Exactly  n
       wide  characters  are  written  at  dest.  If the length wcslen(src) is
       smaller than n, the remaining wide characters in the array  pointed  to
       by   dest  are  filled  with  null  wide  characters.   If  the  length
       wcslen(src) is greater or equal to n, the string  pointed  to  by  dest
       will not be terminated by a null wide character.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide char‚Äê
       acters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcsncpy() returns dest.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The wcsncpy() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
