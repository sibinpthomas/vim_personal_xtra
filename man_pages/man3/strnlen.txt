STRNLEN(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                STRNLEN(3)



NAME
       strnlen - determine the length of a fixed-size string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       size_t strnlen(const char *s, size_t maxlen);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       strnlen():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  strnlen()  function  returns  the  number  of  bytes in the string
       pointed to by s, excluding the terminating null  byte  ('\0'),  but  at
       most  maxlen.   In doing this, strnlen() looks only at the first maxlen
       bytes at s and never beyond s+maxlen.

RETURN VALUE
       The strnlen() function returns strlen(s), if that is less than  maxlen,
       or  maxlen if there is no null byte ('\0') among the first maxlen bytes
       pointed to by s.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.
