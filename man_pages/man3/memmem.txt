MEMMEM(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 MEMMEM(3)



NAME
       memmem - locate a substring

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <string.h>

       void *memmem(const void *haystack, size_t haystacklen,
                    const void *needle, size_t needlelen);

DESCRIPTION
       The  memmem()  function  finds the start of the first occurrence of the
       substring needle of length needlelen in the  memory  area  haystack  of
       length haystacklen.

RETURN VALUE
       The  memmem()  function  returns a pointer to the beginning of the sub‚Äê
       string, or NULL if the substring is not found.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.

BUGS
       This function was broken in Linux libraries up to  and  including  libc
       5.0.9; there the needle and haystack arguments were interchanged, and a
       pointer to the end of the first occurrence of needle was returned.

       Both old and  new  libc's  have  the  bug  that  if  needle  is  empty,
       haystack-1  (instead  of haystack) is returned.  And glibc 2.0 makes it
       worse, returning a pointer to the last byte of haystack.  This is fixed
       in glibc 2.1.
