ATOF(3)                    Linux Programmer's Manual                   ATOF(3)



NAME
       atof - convert a string to a double

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       double atof(const char *nptr);

DESCRIPTION
       The  atof() function converts the initial portion of the string pointed
       to by nptr to double.  The behavior is the same as

           strtod(nptr, NULL);

       except that atof() does not detect errors.

RETURN VALUE
       The converted value.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The atof() function is thread-safe with exceptions.  It can  be  safely
       used  in  multithreaded  applications,  as  long as setlocale(3) is not
       called to change the locale.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.
