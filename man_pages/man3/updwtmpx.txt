UPDWTMP(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                UPDWTMP(3)



NAME
       updwtmp, logwtmp - append an entry to the wtmp file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <utmp.h>

       void updwtmp(const char *wtmp_file, const struct utmp *ut);
       void logwtmp(const char *line, const char *name, const char *host);

DESCRIPTION
       updwtmp() appends the utmp structure ut to the wtmp file.

       logwtmp()  constructs  a utmp structure using line, name, host, current
       time and current process ID.  Then it calls  updwtmp()  to  append  the
       structure to the wtmp file.

FILES
       /var/log/wtmp
              database of past user logins

CONFORMING TO
       Not  in  POSIX.1-2001.   Present  on Solaris, NetBSD, and perhaps other
       systems.

AVAILABILITY
       Both functions are available under glibc2, but not under  libc5.   How‚Äê
       ever,  logwtmp()  used  to  occur  in  the old libbsd.  These days, the
       logwtmp() function is included in libutil.  (Hence you'll need  to  add
       -lutil to your compiler command line to get it.)

NOTES
       For  consistency  with  the other "utmpx" functions (see getutxent(3)),
       glibc provides (since version 2.1):

       #include <utmpx.h>

       void updwtmpx (const char *wtmpx_file, const struct utmpx *utx);

       This function performs the same task as updwtmp(), but differs in  that
       it takes a utmpx structure as its last argument.
