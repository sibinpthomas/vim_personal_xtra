CLOG(3)                    Linux Programmer's Manual                   CLOG(3)



NAME
       clog, clogf, clogl - natural logarithm of a complex number

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double complex clog(double complex z);
       float complex clogf(float complex z);
       long double complex clogl(long double complex z);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       The  logarithm  clog()  is  the  inverse  function  of  the exponential
       cexp(3).  Thus, if y = clog(z), then z = cexp(y).  The  imaginary  part
       of y is chosen in the interval [-pi,pi].

       One has:

           clog(z) = log(cabs(z)) + I * carg(z)

       Note that z close to zero will cause an overflow.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
