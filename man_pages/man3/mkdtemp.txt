MKDTEMP(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                MKDTEMP(3)



NAME
       mkdtemp - create a unique temporary directory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *mkdtemp(char *template);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       mkdtemp():
           _BSD_SOURCE
           || /* Since glibc 2.10: */
               (_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700)

DESCRIPTION
       The  mkdtemp()  function generates a uniquely named temporary directory
       from template.  The last six characters of template must be XXXXXX  and
       these  are replaced with a string that makes the directory name unique.
       The directory is then created with permissions 0700.  Since it will  be
       modified,  template  must  not  be  a  string  constant,  but should be
       declared as a character array.

RETURN VALUE
       The mkdtemp() function returns  a  pointer  to  the  modified  template
       string  on  success,  and  NULL  on failure, in which case errno is set
       appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The last six characters of template were not XXXXXX.   Now  tem‚Äê
              plate is unchanged.

       Also see mkdir(2) for other possible values for errno.

VERSIONS
       Available since glibc 2.1.91.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.  This function is present on the BSDs.
