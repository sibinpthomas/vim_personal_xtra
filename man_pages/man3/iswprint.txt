ISWPRINT(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               ISWPRINT(3)



NAME
       iswprint - test for printing wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswprint(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswprint()  function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of  the
       isprint(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character belonging
       to the wide-character class "print".

       The  wide-character  class  "print" is disjoint from the wide-character
       class "cntrl".

       The wide-character class  "print"  contains  the  wide-character  class
       "graph".

RETURN VALUE
       The  iswprint()  function  returns  nonzero  if  wc is a wide character
       belonging to the wide-character class "print".   Otherwise  it  returns
       zero.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswprint() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur‚Äê
       rent locale.
