PTHREAD_KILL_OTHER_THREADS_Linux Programmer's PTHREAD_KILL_OTHER_THREADS_NP(3)



NAME
       pthread_kill_other_threads_np - terminate all other threads in process

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       void pthread_kill_other_threads_np(void);

DESCRIPTION
       pthread_kill_other_threads_np()  has an effect only in the LinuxThreads
       threading implementation.  On that implementation, calling  this  func‐
       tion  causes  the  immediate termination of all threads in the applica‐
       tion, except the calling thread.  The cancellation state and  cancella‐
       tion  type of the to-be-terminated threads are ignored, and the cleanup
       handlers are not called in those threads.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a nonstandard GNU extension; hence  the  suffix  "_np"
       (nonportable) in the name.

NOTES
       pthread_kill_other_threads_np()  is intended to be called just before a
       thread calls  execve(2)  or  a  similar  function.   This  function  is
       designed to address a limitation in the obsolete LinuxThreads implemen‐
       tation whereby the other threads of an application  are  not  automati‐
       cally terminated (as POSIX.1-2001 requires) during execve(2).

       In  the  NPTL threading implementation, pthread_kill_other_threads_np()
       exists, but does nothing.  (Nothing  needs  to  be  done,  because  the
       implementation does the right thing during an execve(2).)

SEE ALSO
       execve(2),  pthread_cancel(3),  pthread_setcancelstate(3), pthread_set‐
       canceltype(3), pthreads(7)
