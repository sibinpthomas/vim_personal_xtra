ABORT(3)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  ABORT(3)



NAME
       abort - cause abnormal process termination

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       void abort(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The  abort()  first  unblocks  the SIGABRT signal, and then raises that
       signal for the calling process.  This results in the abnormal  termina‐
       tion  of the process unless the SIGABRT signal is caught and the signal
       handler does not return (see longjmp(3)).

       If the abort() function causes process termination,  all  open  streams
       are closed and flushed.

       If  the SIGABRT signal is ignored, or caught by a handler that returns,
       the abort() function will still terminate the process.  It does this by
       restoring the default disposition for SIGABRT and then raising the sig‐
       nal for a second time.

RETURN VALUE
       The abort() function never returns.
