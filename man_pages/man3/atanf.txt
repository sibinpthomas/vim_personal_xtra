ATAN(3)                    Linux Programmer's Manual                   ATAN(3)



NAME
       atan, atanf, atanl - arc tangent function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double atan(double x);
       float atanf(float x);
       long double atanl( long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       atanf(), atanl():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 ||
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The atan() function calculates the principal value of the  arc  tangent
       of x; that is the value whose tangent is x.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, these functions return the principal value of the arc tan‚Äê
       gent of x in radians; the return value is in the range [-pi/2, pi/2].

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is +0 (-0), +0 (-0) is returned.

       If x  is  positive  infinity  (negative  infinity),  +pi/2  (-pi/2)  is
       returned.

ERRORS
       No errors occur.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.  The variant returning double also conforms to SVr4,
       4.3BSD, C89.
