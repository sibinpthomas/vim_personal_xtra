STRSEP(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 STRSEP(3)



NAME
       strsep - extract token from string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strsep(char **stringp, const char *delim);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       strsep(): _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       If  *stringp is NULL, the strsep() function returns NULL and does noth‐
       ing else.  Otherwise, this function finds the first token in the string
       *stringp,  where  tokens  are delimited by symbols in the string delim.
       This token is terminated by overwriting the delimiter with a null  byte
       ('\0')  and  *stringp  is  updated to point past the token.  In case no
       delimiter was found, the  token  is  taken  to  be  the  entire  string
       *stringp, and *stringp is made NULL.

RETURN VALUE
       The  strsep()  function  returns  a  pointer  to the token, that is, it
       returns the original value of *stringp.

CONFORMING TO
       4.4BSD.

NOTES
       The strsep() function was introduced as a  replacement  for  strtok(3),
       since  the  latter cannot handle empty fields.  However, strtok(3) con‐
       forms to C89/C99 and hence is more portable.

BUGS
       Be cautious when using this function.  If you do use it, note that:

       * This function modifies its first argument.

       * This function cannot be used on constant strings.

       * The identity of the delimiting character is lost.
