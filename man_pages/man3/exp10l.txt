NAME
       exp10, exp10f, exp10l - base-10 exponential function

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <math.h>

       double exp10(double x);
       float exp10f(float x);
       long double exp10l(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       The exp10() function returns the value of 10 raised to the power of x.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the base-10 exponential value of x.

       For  various special cases, including the handling of infinity and NaN,
       as well as overflows and underflows, see exp(3).

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an  error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       For  a discussion of the errors that can occur for these functions, see
       exp(3).

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are GNU extensions.
