TELLDIR(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                TELLDIR(3)



NAME
       telldir - return current location in directory stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <dirent.h>

       long telldir(DIR *dirp);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       telldir(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The telldir() function returns the current location associated with the
       directory stream dirp.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the telldir() function returns the current location in  the
       directory stream.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropri‐
       ately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  Invalid directory stream descriptor dirp.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The telldir() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       In glibc up to version 2.1.1, the return type of telldir()  was  off_t.
       POSIX.1-2001  specifies  long,  and  this  is the type used since glibc
       2.1.2.

       In early filesystems, the value returned by telldir() was a simple file
       offset  within a directory.  Modern filesystems use tree or hash struc‐
       tures, rather than flat tables,  to  represent  directories.   On  such
       filesystems,  the  value  returned by telldir() (and used internally by
       readdir(3)) is a "cookie" that is used by the implementation to  derive
       a  position within a directory.  Application programs should treat this
       strictly as an opaque value, making no assumptions about its contents.
