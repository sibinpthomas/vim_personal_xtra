SIGNBIT(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                SIGNBIT(3)



NAME
       signbit - test sign of a real floating-point number

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       int signbit(x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       signbit():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE ||
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       signbit() is a generic macro which can work on all real  floating-point
       types.   It  returns a nonzero value if the value of x has its sign bit
       set.

       This is not the same as x < 0.0, because IEEE 754 floating point allows
       zero  to  be  signed.   The  comparison  -0.0 < 0.0 is false, but sign‐
       bit(-0.0) will return a nonzero value.

       NaNs and infinities have a sign bit.

RETURN VALUE
       The signbit() macro returns nonzero if the sign of x is negative;  oth‐
       erwise it returns zero.

ERRORS
       No errors occur.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The signbit() macro is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.  This function is defined in IEC 559 (and the appen‐
       dix with recommended functions in IEEE 754/IEEE 854).
