NAME
       casin, casinf, casinl - complex arc sine

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double complex casin(double complex z);
       float complex casinf(float complex z);
       long double complex casinl(long double complex z);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       The  casin()  function  calculates  the  complex  arc  sine  of  z.  If
       y = casin(z), then z = csin(y).  The real part of y is  chosen  in  the
       interval [-pi/2,pi/2].

       One has:

           casin(z) = -i clog(iz + csqrt(1 - z * z))

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
